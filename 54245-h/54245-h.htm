<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>For a country of comparatively small extent,
and with a large proportion of its soil in
moor and mountain, histories of Scotland have
been numerous and well-nigh exhaustive. The
present work is not a chronicle of events in order
and detail, but a series of pictures from the earlier
history, expanding into fuller narratives of the
more striking events in later times. And it
includes portions of contemporaneous English
history; for the history of Scotland can only be
fully understood through that of its larger and
more powerful neighbour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The growth of a people out of semi-barbarism
and tribal diversity, to civilization and national
autonomy, is ever an interesting study. This
growth in Scotland included many elements.
The Roman occupation of Southern Britain
banded together for defence and aggression the
northern tribes. For centuries after the Roman
evacuation the old British race held the south-western
shires, up to the Clyde; the Anglo-Saxon
kingdom of Northumbria extended to the
Frith of Forth; there were Norse settlements on
the eastern coast, in Orkney, and the Hebrides.
Of the various races out of which the Scottish
nation was formed, the Picts were the most
numerous; but the Scots—a kindred race,
wanderers from Ireland—were the more active
and aggressive—came to assume the general
government, and gave their name to the whole
country north of the Solway and the Tweed.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is interesting to trace how, in unsettled
times, the burghs developed into little, distinct
communities, largely self-governed. And the
religious element in Scotland has been a powerful
factor in shaping the character of the people and
of the national institutions; the conflict of the
Covenant was the epic in Scottish history. The
rebellion of 1745, as the last specially Scottish
incident in British history, is properly the closing
chapter in <cite>Bygone Scotland</cite>.</p>

  <h2 id='ch01' class='c004'>The Roman Conquest of Britain.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>We cannot tell—it is highly improbable that
we ever shall know—from whence came
the original inhabitants of the islands of Great
Britain and Ireland. Men living on the sea-coasts
of the great quadrant of continental land
which fronts these islands, would, when the art
of navigation got beyond the raft and canoe,
venture to cross the narrow seas, and form insular
settlements. It is indeed possible that, before
that subsidence of the land of Western Europe
which separated our islands from the mainland
and from each other, was effected by the slow
but ever-acting forces of geology, men were living
on the banks of ancient rivers which are now
represented by the Clyde, the Thames, and the
Shannon.</p>

<p class='c006'>The authentic history of Britain dates from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Roman invasion; before this event all is myth
and legend. Half a century before the commencement
of our era, Julius Cæsar, whilst
consolidating in strong and durable Roman
fashion his conquest of Gaul, was informed by
certain merchants of the country that on the
other side of the narrow sea which bounded them
on the north, there was a fertile land called
Britain, or <em>the land of tin</em>. With his legions,
in the trireme galleys of the period, Cæsar crossed
the narrow sea, and, so far as he went, he
conquered the land.</p>

<p class='c006'>The inhabitants were in a rude condition of
life; semi-barbarous perhaps, but certainly the
peoples of Fingal and Ossian in the north, and of
Caractacus and Boadicea in the south, had
advanced far beyond simple savagery. Climatic
and geographical influences had moulded into
a robust, if a fierce and stubborn type, the
common materials of humanity. The ancient
Britons had, in their ideas of government,
advanced beyond mere clan chieftainship. Their
annals, in stone cairns and the songs of bards,
commemorated bygone battles and deeds of
warrior renown. They had a religion with its
trained priesthood—it was not a religion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>sweetness and light, but of ferocity and gloom,
of human sacrifices, and mystical rites. Its
temples and altars were clusters of huge stones,
arranged in forest glades on some astronomical
principles. The Druidic faith was one of the
many offshoots of ignorant barbarism, in which
the celestial orbs and the forces in terrestrial
nature—lightning and tempest—life and fire—were
deified. Its priesthood was a close order,
holding in their mystical gripe the minds and
lives of the people. It has been said that the
ancient Britons were such firm believers in a
future state, that they would even lend each
other money, to be repaid in the spiritual world.
Their language was a dialect of the Gaelic—the
language spoken in more ancient times over
the greater portion of Western Europe.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Roman invasion under Julius was little
more than a raid. He marched his legions
as far inland as the Thames, and again retired
to the coast; he left Britain without forming
a Roman settlement, and for nearly a hundred
years the island remained free, and did a
considerable maritime trade with Gaul and
Scandinavia. In <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 43, the fourth Roman
emperor, Claudius, with a large army, invaded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Britain. The native tribes, although generally
inimical to the Romans, had no concerted action
amongst themselves, were often, indeed, at war
with each other; and thus the disciplined soldiers
of Rome had a comparatively easy task, although
they had many fierce encounters with native
bravery and hardihood. One British chief,
Caractacus, held out the longest. He was the
King of the Silurians, the dwellers in South
Wales and its neighbourhood. For several
years he withstood the masters of the world,
but was ultimately defeated in battle, and he and
his family were sent prisoners to Rome.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the eastern coast, in what is now Suffolk
and Norfolk, was a tribe called the Icenians.
This tribe, under Boadicea, the widow of one of
its kings, made, in the absence of the Roman
governor, Suetonius, raids upon London,
Colchester, and other Roman towns. When
Suetonius returned, he defeated Boadicea in a
battle near London. She killed herself rather
than submit. Agricola succeeded Suetonius as
governor, and he pushed the Roman Conquest
northwards to a line between the Firths of Forth
and Clyde. Beyond this line the Romans never
made permanent conquests. Along this line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Agricola built a chain of forts as a defence of
the Roman province against incursions from the
northern tribes, and as a base of operations in
attempting farther conquests. In a campaign in
the year 84, he was opposed by a native force
under a chief called Galgacus. A battle was
fought amongst the Grampian Hills, near Blairgowrie,
with a hardly-won victory to Agricola.
It was such a victory as decided him to make the
Tay the northern boundary of Roman occupation.
But Roman fleets sailed round the northern
shores,—planting the Imperial Standard on
Orkney,—and returned, having proved that
Britain was an island.</p>

<p class='c006'>The northern portion of the island, beyond the
line of forts, was then called Caledonia; border
fighting was the rule, and the “barbarians from
the hills” made frequent raids into the Romanized
lowlands. Indeed, not only had the Romans to
build a wall connecting the forts of Agricola, but
also, as a second line of defence, one between the
Tyne and the Solway Firth. The two walls
prove the determination of the Romans to maintain
their British conquests, and also at what a
high rate they estimated the native resistance.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 208, Severus had to re-conquer the country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>between the walls, restoring that of Agricola, and
he carried the Roman eagles to the farthest
points north which they ever reached. The
remains of Roman roads through Strathearn to
Perth, and thence through Forfar, the Mearns,
and Aberdeen to the Moray Firth, belong to this
period; and they represent attempts to subdue
the whole island. Dion, the Roman historian,
ascribes the failure of this attempt to the death of
Severus at York, in 211. He describes the
Caledonians as painting on their skins the forms
of animals; of being lightly armed; making
rapid dashes in battle; of having no king, only
their tribal chieftains. In 305, Constantius
defeated the tribes between the walls; they are
called in the Roman records, “Caledonians and
other Picts;” the latter name being then used for
the first time, and as being the more generic
appellation. In 360, the Scots are named for the
first time. They and the Picts made a descent
upon the Roman province, and this is spoken of
in terms which imply that they had previously
passed the southern wall.</p>

<p class='c006'>For about 366 years the Romans held sway in
Britain; if we think of it, for as long a period
as elapsed between Henry the Eighth’s publishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>his treatise in defence of the seven Romish
sacraments, and the jubilee of Queen Victoria.
The conquest of an inferior by a superior race is
generally fraught with progressive issues to the
conquered people. In the roads and architecture,
the laws and the civic institutions of the country,
the Romans left lasting memorials of their British
rule. Towns rose and flourished; marshes were
drained; the land was cultivated; low-lying coast
lands were, by embankments, protected from the
sea; trade advanced; Christianity and Roman
literature were introduced.</p>

<p class='c006'>As a constituent portion of the empire, Britain
occupies a place in Roman history. A Roman
commander in Britain, Albinus, had himself
nominated emperor. He carried an army into
Gaul, but was there beaten and slain in a battle
with the rival emperor, Severus. Severus himself
died at York, then called Eboracum; and, in
273, Constantine, since styled <em>The Great</em>, was
born in that city, his mother, Helena, being
British. Constantius, the father of Constantine,
had a long struggle for the possession of Britain
with Carausius, a Belgian-born Roman general,
who, in 286, rebelled against the authority of the
empire. The usurper formed a navy, with which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>he for eight years prevented Roman troops from
landing on our shores, but he lost his life through
treachery, and once more the imperial eagles
floated over Britain. For a time Britain might
be said to be the head-quarters of the empire.
Residing principally at York, Constantius gave
his commands to Gaul and Spain, to Italy itself,
to Syria and Greece. It was in Britain that on
the death of his father, in 306, Constantine was
proclaimed emperor. He was the first Christian
emperor, and all the emperors who succeeded him
professed Christianity, except Julian, who, returning
to the old gods, was called <em>The Apostate</em>; but
Julian was really a wiser ruler and a better man
than many of those who called themselves
Christian. The new religion became the official
faith of the empire. Not much is known with
certainty of the early British church, but there
are said to have been archbishops in the three
chief cities, London, York, and Caerleon.</p>

<p class='c006'>The grand old Latin language, containing in
its literature the garnered up thoughts and attainments
of centuries, spread its refining influences
wherever the Roman camp was pitched. Latin
was the official language in Roman Britain, and it
would be known and probably spoken by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>well-to-do Britons in the towns. But it never
amalgamated with the old Celtic-Welsh of the
common people. Celtic, although in many
respects a well-constructed language, is not a
pliant one—is not adapted for readily intermingling
with other tongues. It has in its various
dialects, which have through the succeeding
centuries maintained their existence in Wales, in
Ireland, and in the Highlands of Scotland, kept
itself altogether apart from the English language;
and it has given comparatively few of its words to
the modern tongue.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the third century the Roman empire was in
its decline, and hastening to its fall. Constantine
transferred the seat of government to Byzantium,
and that city was thenceforth named from him,
Constantinople; and then the Roman power was
divided—there were eastern emperors and
western emperors. In the Patriarch of the
Greek Church residing in Constantinople and the
Pope of the Catholic Church in Rome, we have
that division perpetuated to this day.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Romans had never been able to conquer
more than small portions of the great country in
Central Europe which lies north of the Danube
and east of the Rhine, which we now call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Germany. One Teutonic chief called Arminius,
afterwards styled <em>The Deliverer</em>, destroyed a
whole Roman invading army. Towards the end
of the fourth century the Teutonic nations began
to press into the Roman empire, and one by one
the provinces were wrested from it by these
incursions. The Romans hired one tribe against
another; but stage by stage the empire shrank
in its dimensions, until it came to be within the
frontiers of Italy; and still the barbarians pressed
in.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 24th day of August, 410, the evening
sun was gilding the roof of the venerable Capitol,
and peace and serenity seemed to hover over the
eternal city. But at midnight the Gothic
trumpets sounded as the blasts of doom. No
devoted Horatius now kept bridge and gate as
in the brave days of old. Alaric, “the curse of
God,” stormed the city, to burn and slay and
inflict all the horrors of assault; but sparing
Christian churches, monks and nuns. It is said
that forty thousand slaves in the city rose against
their masters.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the spreading of the Teutonic tribes,
new nations were formed in Western Europe.
The Franks pressed into Northern Gaul. Their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>name remains in Franconia, and in that portion of
Gaul called France. In Italy, Spain, and
Acquitaine, the Goths and other Teutonic
peoples mingled with the Romans. From the
Latin language, corrupted and mixed up with
other tongues, arose the Italian, Spanish,
Provençal, and French languages, all, from the
name of Rome, called the <em>Romance</em> languages.
The eastern empire still went on; in the sixth
century it recovered for a time Italy and Africa.
Its people called themselves Romans, but were
not so much Roman as Greek. After a
lengthened decline, its last fragments were
destroyed by the Turks, who took Constantinople
in 1453.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c004'>Britain as a Roman Province.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>It was fortunate for Britain that it came under
the rule of Rome, not in the time of the
Republic, when the conquered peoples were
ruined by spoliation and enslavement; nor yet in
the earlier years of the empire, a time of conflict
and unsettlement, but after the death of the
infamous Caligula, when Claudius had assumed
the purple. At the beginning of the second
century the Roman Empire was, under Trajan, at
its culminating point of magnitude and power.
Trajan was succeeded by Hadrian, whose
governmental solicitude was shown in continuous
journeying over his vast empire; and by the
general construction of border fortification, of
which the wall in Britain, linking the Tyne with
the Solway Firth, is an example. Antoninus
followed Hadrian, and of him it has been said:
“With such diligence did he rule the subject
peoples that he cared for every man of them,
equally as for his own nation; all the provinces
flourished under him.” His reign was tranquil,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and his fine personal qualities obtained for him
the title of <i>Pius</i>. Of course for Britain it was
the rough rule of military conquest; but it
prevented tribal conflicts, secured order, and
encouraged material development; corn was
exported, the potter’s wheel was at work, there
was tin-mining in Cornwall, and lead-mining in
Northumberland and Somerset; iron was smelted
in the Forest of Dean.</p>

<p class='c006'>But distance from the seat of government, as
well as its murky skies, and wintry severity—no
vines, no olive or orange trees in its fields—made
Britain an undesirable land for Roman colonisation;
it was held chiefly as a military outpost of
the empire.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whilst the more intimate Roman rule in South
Britain gave there its civilizing institutions, its
Latin tongue, its arts, laws, and literature, and in
the fourth century Christianity, these results
became less emphasized northwards—hardly
reaching to the wall of Hadrian. The country
between the walls remained in the possession of
heathen semi-barbarians, scarcely more civilized or
trained in the arts of civil government than were
the Celtic tribes of the north. There were no
Roman towns, and very few remains of Roman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>villas have been found, beyond York: remains of
roads and camps, of altars and sepulchral
monuments are found. To the south of York,
Britain was a Roman settlement; north of York
it was a military occupation.</p>

<p class='c006'>In spite of its roads, its towns, and its mines,
Britain was still, at the close of the Roman rule, a
wild, half-reclaimed country; forest and wasteland,
marsh and fen occupied the larger portion of
its surface. The wolf was still a terror to the
shepherd; beavers built their dams in the marshy
streams of Holderness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Unarmed, and without any military training,
feeling themselves weak and helpless in the
presence of the dominant race, the Britons of the
province were yet sufficiently patriotic, to give
negative help at least to the Pictish tribes who
were ever making incursions into the district
between the walls, and even at times penetrating
into the heart of the province. One of these
inroads in the reign of Valentinian all but tore
Britain from the empire: an able general, Theodosius,
found southern Britain itself in the hands of
the invaders; but he succeeded in driving them
back to their mountains, winning back for Rome
the land as far as the wall of Agricola, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>district between the walls was constituted a fifth
British province, named after the Emperor,
Valentia.</p>

<p class='c006'>And whilst the Pictish clans were thus making
wild dashes over the walls, the sea-board of the
province was harrassed by marauders from the
sea. Irish pirates called Scots, or “wanderers,”
harried the western shores; whilst on the
eastern and southern coast, from the Wash to the
Isle of Wight, a stretch of coast which came to
be called the Saxon Shore, Saxon war-keels were
making sudden raids for plunder, and for
kidnapping men, women, and children, to be sold
into slavery. They also intercepted Roman
galleys in the Channel, which were engaged in
commerce, or on imperial business. In the year
364, a combined fleet of Saxon vessels for a time
held the Channel.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now the Romanized British towns began
to shew their lack of faith in imperial protection,
by strengthening themselves by walls. A special
Roman commander was appointed, charged with
the defence of the Saxon shore. The shore was
dotted by strong forts, garrisoned by a legion of
ten thousand men. The thick forests which lined
the coast to the westward of Southampton water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>were considered sufficient guards against invasion
in that quarter. As long as the Romans
remained in Britain they were able to repel the
attacks of their barbarous assailants. But when
the fated hour came—when Rome in her death-struggle
with the Teutonic hordes, whose gripe
was at her throat in every one of her dominions
in western Europe, and even in Italy itself, had
to recall her troops from Britain—then the
encircling foes closed in upon their prey.</p>

<p class='c006'>In withdrawing, in 410, his troops from Britain,
the Emperor Honorius, grandson of the general
Theodosius we have mentioned, told the people in
a letter to provide for their own government and
defence. We may imagine how ill prepared, after
ten generations of servitude, the Romanized
Britons were for such an emergency. But they had
fortified towns with their municipal institutions,
and under the general sway of Rome they had
lost their tribal distinctions, and become a more
united people; and not in any one of the
Romanized lands which became a prey to the
barbarians did these encounter so prolonged and
so energetic a resistance as in Britain. For some
thirty years after the Roman evacuation of the
province, it held out or maintained a fluctuating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>struggle with its enemies. The Scoto-Irish
bucaneers were not only continuing their raids
upon the western coast, but they planted
settlements in Argyle to the north of Agricola’s
wall, and in Galloway—between the two walls.
And the Picts were ever making incursions from
the north. The policy was tried of hiring
barbarian against barbarian. The Picts were the
nearest and most persistent danger; and the
marauders from over the North Sea,—Saxons,
Angles, and Jutes, were, if not hired as
mercenaries, permitted to hold a footing in the
land, as a defence against Pictish invasion.
About 450, three keels filled with Jutes, under
two brothers, Hengist and Horsa, with a white
horse as their cognisance, came by invitation from
their own home—which is from them called
Jutland—and landed on the Isle of Thanet on the
eastern Kentish shore, making this their base for
further conquests.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c004'>The Anglo-Saxons in Britain.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>The Teutonic nations from mid-Europe
which, in their various tribes, conquered
Italy, Spain, and Gaul, had had previous
intercourse with the empire. Many had become
Christians, and in their conquests they did not
destroy. Their kings ruled the invaded lands,
and their chiefs seized large portions of soil; but
they adopted the provincial Latin tongues, and
the general government was by Roman law.
The clergy were mostly Romans, and they
retained considerable power and estates. Thus
the Goths, Visigoths, and Vandals did not become
the peoples of the countries which they overran.
The Teutonic element was absorbed into the
national elements, largely resembling what
afterwards took place in England, under the
Norman Conquest.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it was very different in Britain. Its
Teutonic invaders—Jutes, Angles, and Saxons,
had lived outside the influence of the empire; and
indeed we know very little about them before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>they came to Britain. With the landing of Ella,
in 477, Anglo-Saxon history may be said to
begin. They were still heathens, and they knew
nothing, and they cared nothing for the arts, the
laws, or the language of Rome. Their object
was not merely rule and authority over the
Romanized Britons, but their destruction, and the
entire occupation of the land. As they conquered,
they killed the Britons or made them slaves, or
drove them into Cornwall and Wales in the west,
and into Caledonia in the north. They came
over the North Sea in families, and thus
propagated largely as an unmixed Anglo-Saxon
race. But doubtless there were many more men
than women in their bands, and there would be
marriages with native women. Thus strains of
British and Roman blood were left in the new
occupants of what came to be England, and the
lowlands of Scotland. The Anglo-Saxon tribes
in Britain thus became a nation with its own
language and laws, manners and customs. From
the name of one tribe—the Angles—the southern
and larger portion of the island came to be called
<i>England</i>. <i>English</i> is the common language of
Britain, and of its many off-shoots scattered over
the habitable globe.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Kent—the nearest British land to the continent—bore
the first brunt of Anglo-Saxon, as it
had done of Roman, conquest. Then came Sussex
(South Saxon). But the third settlement, that of
Wessex (West Saxon), was a far larger one;
taking in at least seven shires. It began in
Hampshire, under Cedric, and his son Cynric—then
styled Ealdermen—and gradually extended
over all south-western Britain, and stretching
northwards over Oxford and Buckingham shires.
This was the era assigned to the legendary
British King Arthur, fighting strongly for his
native soil and his Christian faith, against the
heathen invaders.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another, the fourth Saxon kingdom, was that of
Essex. And then there were three Anglian
kingdoms—East Anglia, Northumbria and Mercia.
East Anglia comprised Suffolk (South-folk),
Norfolk (North-folk), and Lincolnshire. Northumbria
included the country north of the
Humber, as far as the Frith of Forth. That
portion of Northumbria now known as Yorkshire
was then called Deira, with York, then named
Eboracum, its chief town; the portion north of
the Tees was named Bernicia. The kingdom of
Mercia, that is, of the <i>March</i>, had its western
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>frontier to Wales, being thus the midlands of
England.</p>

<p class='c006'>And besides South Wales, including Cornwall,
Devonshire, and the greater portion of Somersetshire,
the old race still held a large district to the
north of Wales, called Strathclyde, taking in
Galloway and other districts in the south-east of
what is now Scotland; together with Cumberland,
Westmoreland, and Lancashire, down to the river
Dee, and the city of Chester; they, even to the
end of the sixth century, held portions of west
Yorkshire, including Leeds.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Anglo-Saxon occupation having thus at
the close of the sixth century resolved itself into
seven independent governments, is hence called
the Heptarchy. But the division was not a
lasting one. The conquerors, although a kindred
race—with one understood language—and one
old Scandinavian faith, were far from being a
homogeneous people. They had tribal proclivities,
and were generally at war with each other—“battles
of kites and crows,” Milton wrote. At
times one king was powerful, or of such personal
superiority to his neighbours, that he assumed a
suzerainty over them, and was called a <i>Bretwalda</i>.
But the Anglo-Saxon kings were not autocrats;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>they had to consult their Witans—their council
of “witty or wise ones.” And there was in
society the elements of what came to be feudalism.
The King had his Thanes, or Earls; and these
had their <i>churls</i>, who, holding lands under their
lords, were expected to follow him in the wars.
And there was slavery; men were made slaves
who committed crimes, or were taken prisoners
in war.</p>

<p class='c006'>The seventh century witnessed in Anglo-Saxon
Britain the conversion from the old Norse belief
in Odin, Thor, and Fries to the Christian faith.
Not from their British slaves, nor from the
independent British of Wales and Strathclyde,
did the new faith reach them. In 597, Pope
Gregory sent Augustine and a number of other
monks to preach Christianity in England. The
most powerful ruler in Britain at this time was
the Kentish king, Ethelbert; he was Bretwalda,
exercising some authority over all the kings south
of the Humber; and he had married a Frankish
wife who was a Christian. The King received
the missionaries kindly; and they preached to
him and his chief men through interpreters. In
a short time the King and a number of his people
were baptized. Augustine made Canterbury his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>headquarters, and it has ever since been the
chief See of the Anglican Church.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 635, Oswald, King of Northumbria, routed a
British Strathclyde army, largely shattering this
kingdom of the older race; it was as much as the
Welsh could do to hold the country west of the
Severn.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this seventh century, Devon and the whole
of Somersetshire became English. Oswald
was now Bretwalda, and Northumbria, in the
struggles for supremacy of the Saxon kingdoms,
was for a generation the foremost power. It also
became Christian, but more from the labours of
Scottish missionaries from Iona, than from the
successors of Augustine.</p>

<p class='c006'>In early life, Oswald, during an exile
amongst the Scots, had visited Iona, and
there became acquainted with Christianity.
On his return he founded a monastery on
Lindisfarne, thence called Holy Isle; a Scottish
Bishop, Aidan, he placed at its head; a succeeding
Bishop, Cuthbert, was the most famous of the
saints of Northern England. And the Christianity
which came to Scotland from Ireland through
Columba, himself a Dalriadan Scot, differed in
many ways from that which had come from Rome.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Not only did they differ in ritual, in dates of
festivals, and in the shape of the monkish
tonsure, but in what was of more political
importance—ecclesiastical discipline and organization.
The Church of Augustine implied
dioceses, bishops in gradation of rank and
authority, culminating in the Bishop of Rome as
the head of the Church. The Church of
Columba was a network of monasteries, a
missionary church full of the zeal of conversion,
but wanting in the power of organization. And
thus there was conflict between the two churches,
and this conflict was an important factor in the
political history of the times. Ultimately the
policy of Rome prevailed. The country was
divided into dioceses, the loose system of the
mission-station sending out priests to preach and
baptize as their enthusiasm led them, gave place
to the parish system with its regular incumbency,
and settled order.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the beginning of the ninth century the strife
for headship over the others, which had been
long waged by the kings of the stronger
kingdoms, was terminated by the Northumbrian
Thanes owning Egbert, King of Wessex, as their
over-lord.  Egbert defeated the Britons in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Cornwall, brought Mercia under his rule, and
united all the territories south of the Tweed.
The Kings of Wessex were henceforth, so far as
Anglo-Saxon rivals were concerned, Kings of
England.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>In the second century, Ptolemy, the Egyptian
astronomer, composed the first geography of
the world, illustrated by maps. He would probably
get his information about Britain—which
was still called Albion—from Roman officers.
What is now England, is shown with fair
accuracy; but north of the Wear and the Solway
it is difficult to identify names, or even the
prominent features of the country; and the
configuration of the land stretches east and west,
instead of north and south.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Celts were not indigenous to Britain. It
is hardly possible to trace in any—in the very
earliest peoples, of whom history or archæology
can speak—the first occupants of any one spot on
the earth. Science is ever pushing back, and still
farther back, the era of man’s first appearance as
fully developed man upon the globe. And in his
families, his tribes, and his nations, man has ever
been a migrant. Impelled by the necessities of
life, or by his love of adventure or of conquest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>he has changed his hunting and grazing grounds,
made tracks through forests, sought out passes
between mountains; and the great, all-encompassing
sea has ever been a fascination; the sound
of its waves a siren-song inciting him to make
them a pathway to new lands beyond his horizon.
Before the Celtic Britons dwelt in this island in
the northern seas, which they have helped to a
great name, there were tribes here who had not yet
learned the uses of the metals, whose spear-heads
and arrow-tips were flints, their axes and
hammers of stone. But the Celts were of that
great Aryan race, tribes of which, spreading
westwards over Europe, had carried with them
so much of the older civilization of Persia, that
they never degenerated into savagedom. The
Britons were probably in pre-Roman times the
only distinctive people upon the island.</p>

<p class='c006'>How came the Celts to Britain? Probably
colonies from Old Gaul first took possession of
the portions of Britain nearer to their own
country; and gradually spreading northwards,
came in time to be scattered over what is now
England and Wales, and the Lowlands of
Scotland. Ireland being in sight of Britain from
both Wigton and Cantyre, adventurers would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>cross the North Channel, and become the
founders of the Irish nation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Picts—a Latin name for the first northern
tribes whom the Romans distinguished from the
Britons—called themselves <i>Cruithne</i>. Their
earliest settlements in and near Britain appear to
have been in the Orkneys, the north-east of
Ireland, and the north of Scotland. They must
then have made considerable advancement in the
art of navigation. At the time of the Roman
invasion, the southern Britons called the dwellers
in the northern part of the island <i>Cavill daoin</i>,
or “people of the woods,”—and thus the Romans
named the district Caledonia. It has been surmised
that the Picts of ancient Caledonia were a
colony of Celtic-Germans; for such offshoots
from the parent race occupied portions of central
Europe. There was the same element of Druidism;
but the Druids in Caledonia declined in
influence and authority at an earlier date than
did their brethren in Wales and South Britain.
The bards took their place in preserving and
handing down—orally and in verse—the traditions
of their tribes—the heroism and virtues, the loves
and adventures, of their ancestors. It may be
noted that whilst in this early poetry the spirits of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the dead are frequently introduced, and the
powers of nature—sun, moon, and stars, the wind,
the thunder, and the sea—are personified, there is
no mythology,—no deities are called in to aid the
heroes in battling with their foes.</p>

<p class='c006'>By the end of the Roman occupation, the
Caledonian Picts had spread down east and
central Scotland as far as Fife. And there are
Pictish traces in Galloway on the west coast;
probably a migration from Ireland. After the
Romans left, the Picts, in their southern raids,
so often crossed and made use of Hadrian’s wall,
that the Romanized-Britons came to call it the
Pictish wall. Their language was a dialect of
Celtic, afterwards coalescing with, or being
absorbed in, the Gaelic of the Scots, and which
came to be the common tongue in the Highlands
and western isles; but it was never a spoken
tongue in the Scottish Lowlands.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Scots are first found historically in
Ireland; and they were there in such numbers
and influence, that one of the names of Ireland
from the sixth to the twelfth century was Scotia.
Irish traditions represent the Scotti as “Milesians
from Spain;” Milesia was said to be the name
of the leader of the colonizing expedition. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>their Celtic name of Gael sounds akin to Gaul.
Their history in Ireland forms an important
factor in the annals of that country. Those
of the Irish people who considered themselves
the descendants of the earlier colonists of the
island never came heartily to recognise as fellow-countrymen,—although
these had been for many
generations natives of the land,—the descendants
of those who settled at a later date. On the
other hand—and similarly keeping up old race
hatreds and lines of demarcation—the descendants
of the later settlers looked upon themselves as
a superior race, and never heartily called themselves
Irishmen. This restricted and mock
patriotism, aggravated by religious differences,
has almost made of the Irish people two nations.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Scotti must have made considerable
settlements in North Britain in the second or
third century, or they would not have been in a
position to join the Picts in attacks upon the
Roman province in the fourth century. When
we come to enquire who were the peoples
associated with the Christian missionary Columba
in the latter half of the sixth century, we find
that the districts bordering the east coast down
to the Firth of Forth, and the central Highlands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>with the chief fort at Inverness, were peopled
by Picts; and that Scots were in Argyle and the
Isles as far north as Iona. Their settlement
around the shores of Loch Linnhe—the arm of
the sea at the entrance to which Oban now
stands—became in time a little kingdom called
Dalriada, which gradually shook off the over-lordship
of the Scotic kings in Ireland, and
maintained itself against the Picts on its northern
and eastern borders. A British king ruled in
Strathclyde, which included the south-west of
Scotland up to the Clyde; and, bordering on
Strathclyde, Anglo-Saxon Northumbria included
the east of Scotland up to the Forth. Up to
this time the Celts in North Britain had left no
written history behind them; indicating that they
were less civilized than their Welsh and Irish kin.
It is in the annals of Beda and other Anglo-Saxon
writers that we find anything like trustworthy
history after the departure of the Romans.
The Romanized Britons got Christianity from
their rulers, but subjection to the Bishop of Rome
was not transmitted with the faith. The British
bishops, at their meeting under St. Augustine’s
oak, declined to submit to the missionary from
Rome.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>It is usually said that Scotland gave Patrick to
Ireland. It was a strange kind of <em>giving</em>.
Shortly after the Roman exodus, amongst a
number of Britons taken captive by a Scotti-Irish
raid on the banks of the Clyde, was a young
lad of sixteen, who was sent as a slave to tend
sheep and cattle in Antrim. The people round
him were idolators; but in the solitude of the
pastures he nursed the Christian faith of his
childhood, and burned with the zeal of a young
apostle for the conversion of the land. For ten
years he remained in captivity, then he made his
escape, and after many wanderings, reached his
old home. Ordained a priest, and in time a
bishop, he set manfully to realize in Ireland the
dream of his youth, and he had abundant success.
He founded churches, seminaries, and monasteries;
the new faith spread like wildfire over the land.</p>

<p class='c006'>And a century later, in 563, thirty-three years
before the Roman mission of Augustine, Ireland
sent over Columba to Britain. He, with twelve
companion monks, founded on the little isle of
Iona a monastery, which became the centre of
Christianity in North Britain. The Scotti who
had settled in the neighbouring islands, and on
the nearest mainland, were already Christians.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>But Columba visited and converted the Pictish
King Bruda, and founded a number of churches
and monasteries. Than Iona there is no spot of
greater historical interest in the United Kingdom;
but none of the ecclesiastical ruins found there
date from Columba. The first buildings were of
wood, but the original foundations in Skye and
Tiree were his work. Columba was also a
warrior, taking a strong part in several campaigns
in Ireland, as a liegeman of the Scotic
King. The disciples of Columba were called
Culdees, meaning, from their monastic life,
“sequestered persons.” The Pictish bard
Ossian is said, when blind and in old age, to
have met and conversed with one of these
Culdees. After ten years of prosperous rule in
Iona, Columba contributed to start into greater
unity and more vigorous life the Scotic settlement
of Dalriada. He consecrated a young
chieftain, Aedhan, as king; and Aedhan drove
the Bernicians from the debatable land south of
the head-waters of the Forth, and formed a
league of Scots and Strathclyde Britons against
Northumbria itself. But the league was, in 603,
defeated by the Northumbrian King Ethelfrith in
a great battle. The Scots were thrown back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>into their Highland fastnesses, and Beda says,
writing a hundred years later, “From that day to
this no Scot King has dared to come into battle
with the English folk.” Ethelfrith, by another
victory over the Welsh at Chester, in 611, and
further successes up to Carlisle, divided by a
great gap the Kingdom of Strathclyde from
North Wales, and it became tributary to Northumbria.
On the decline of Northumbria, in the
eighth century, Strathclyde re-asserted its independence;
and, in a restricted sense, its extent,
more nearly answered to its name, “The Valley
of the Clyde.” With Galloway, it continued
under its own rulers, until, in the tenth century, it
was connected with the Kingdom of Scone by
the election to its throne—if it could afford a
throne—of Donald, brother of Constantine II.,
King of Scots.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Picts whom Columba converted appear to
have been then consolidated under one monarch,
Brude; his rule was from Inverness to Iona on the
west; on the north to the Orkneys—probably
including Aberdeen; its southern boundary is
undefined. Of succeeding kings to Brude, there
is a list of names; but little is known of the men
themselves until, in 731, we come to Angus Mac-Fergus.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>In reprisal for the capture of his son by
Selvach, King of the Dalriad Scots, he attacked
Argyle, and reduced the whole western highlands.
The Strathclyde Britons were assailed by a
brother of Angus, in 756, and their chief town,
Alclyde, destroyed. In the beginning of the
ninth century, the seat of the Pictish government
appears to have migrated from Inverness
into Perthshire,—Scone becoming its political
capital.</p>

<p class='c006'>The history of the Dalriadan Scots, although
interwoven with that of the Picts, and meeting at
many points with the histories of the Britons of
Strathclyde, and the Angles of Northumbria, is
yet misty and legendary. True, there is a list of
kings, and their stalwart portraits hang in the
great hall of Holyrood; so extensive is this list, that
if they had reigned for anything like an average
period, it would carry the history back to about
three hundred years <span class='fss'>B.C.</span></p>

<p class='c006'>We find something like a trustworthy beginning
in Fergus, the son of Earac, in 503.
From this date for upwards of two hundred
years, down to Selvach, who was conquered
by the Pictish King Angus Mac-Fergus,
there is from the <cite>Irish Annals</cite>, and the <cite>Church History</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>of Beda, a reasonable certainty. After
this there is another century of hazy legend.
If, as seems probable, Dalriada continued
through the latter seventy years of the eighth,
and the first half of the ninth century, under
Pictish rule, it is not easy to see how, in the
middle of the ninth century, Kenneth Mac-Alpine,
called in the <cite>Irish Annals</cite> a king of the Picts,
founded, as there is no doubt he did, a line of
Scottish monarchs on the throne of Scone. One
hypothesis is, that Kenneth was the son of a
Pictish king by a Scottish mother, and by the
Pictish law, the mother’s nationality determined
that of the children. Whatever the circumstances
of the case, the accession of Kenneth Mac-Alpine
represents an era in Scottish history. There was
thenceforth such a complete union of Scots and
Picts, that as separate races they lost all distinctiveness.
But it certainly appears that, both by
numerical superiority and historical prestige, the
country should have been Pictland, rather than
Scotland.</p>

<p class='c006'>The kingdom of Kenneth included central
Scotland from sea to sea, Argyle and the Isles,
Perthshire, Fife, Angus, and the Mearns. Lothian
was still Northumbrian. The Vale of the Clyde,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Ayr, Dumfries, and Galloway, were under a
British king at Dumbarton. There were several
independent chieftains in Moray and Mar; and
Orkney and the northern and north-western
fringes of the country, were dominated by
Norsemen.</p>

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c004'>The Danish Invasions of Britain.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>In the first quarter of the ninth century,
invaders from lands farther north than
Jutland—hence called Norsemen—played broadly
the same parts in Britain as the Angles and
Saxons had played three hundred years
previously. These Norsemen, in their war
galleys, prowled over the Northern Seas, plundering
the coasts, and making first incursions and
then settlements in Muscovy, Britain, and Gaul.
They discovered and colonised Iceland. Many
centuries before Columbus, they had sailed along
the coast of North America, and even attempted
settlements thereon. On the northern coast of
France, Normandy, under its powerful dukes, had
become almost an independent state.</p>

<p class='c006'>In their English invasions they are commonly
called Danes, but in their own homes they
formed three kingdoms, Norway, Sweden, and
Denmark. Probably the invaders of England
were mainly Danes. They were still “heathens,”
<i>i.e.</i>, of the old Scandinavian faith; and they held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the Christian faith in supreme detestation. They
were daring, fierce, and cruel; but still people of
a kindred race, speaking dialects of the same
Teutonic tongue; and when they settled in the
land and became Christians, their language and
manners differed so little from those of the
Anglo-Saxons, that they did not remain a
separate nation, as the Anglo-Saxons did from
the British. It was more as if another Teuton
tribe had come over and become joint occupants
of the land. But, to begin with, they came as
plunderers, taking their booty home. They
ravaged Berkshire, Hampshire, and Surrey,
destroying churches and monasteries. They
invaded and took possession of East Anglia.
They penetrated into Mercia; at Peterborough
they burned the minster, slaying the abbot and
his monks. They made extensive settlements in
Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 876, the Danes invaded Wessex, of which
Alfred—one of the grandest names in old
English history—was then King. Alfred had to
fight the invaders both on sea and land. In and
about Exeter there were several engagements,
resulting in the Danes agreeing to leave Alfred’s
territories. Two years later they broke truce,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>made a sudden incursion to Chippenham, and
became for a time masters of the west country.
This is the time assigned to the neatherd-cottage
negligence of Alfred, in allowing the
cakes to burn in baking, whilst sheltering
amongst the wood and morasses of Somersetshire.
After a time he organised a sufficient
army to meet, fight with, and beat the Danes—they
gave him oaths and hostages against further
disturbance, and their King Guthrum—thence
called Athelstan—with thirty of his chief
followers were baptized. But the Danes now
held East Anglia, Northumbria, and large
portions of Essex and Mercia,—indeed more than
one-half of what is now England. Alfred being
in peace during the latter years of his reign,
devoted himself to works of governmental utility,
he made a digest of the laws, and saw that justice
was impartially administered; and he was the
father of the English navy. His mind was
cultured with the best learning of the times, and
he made Anglo-Saxon translations of the Psalms,
of Æsop’s Fables, and of Bede’s Church History.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first year of the tenth century, Alfred’s
son, Edward (styled the Elder, so as not to confuse
him with later Edwards), began a reign of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>twenty-five years. He was a strong king;
through all his reign he had conflicts with the
Danes, who had settled in the north and east of
England; always beating them, and then having
to quell fresh insurrections. And he made himself
Over-King of the Scots and Welsh; so he
was the first Anglo-Saxon king who became lord
of nearly all Britain. Wessex, Kent, and Sussex
he had inherited, Wales, Strathclyde, and
Scotland acknowledged him as Suzerain. His
son, Athelstan, succeeded him in 925; and the
King of England now held such a high place
among the rulers of Western Europe, that several
of his sisters married foreign kings and princes.
In 937 a great battle was fought in the North,
when a combination of Scots under Constantine,
and Danes and Irish under Anlaf, were defeated
with much slaughter by Athelstan. It is called
by the old chroniclers the Battle of Brunanburg,
but the locality is uncertain. Constantine and
Anlaf escaped; but Constantine’s son was killed,
as, says the old chronicler, were “five Danish
Kings and seven Jarls.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Athelstan died in 941. Two of his brothers,
and one brother’s son occupied the throne
successively during the next eighteen years.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Then, in 959, Edgar, a grandson of Alfred, then
only sixteen years of age, was by the Witan
made King. He was called <i>The Peaceable</i>;
during his reign of sixteen years, no foe, foreign
or domestic, vexed the land. Northumbria,
extending as far north as the Forth, with
Edwinsburh its border fortress—garrisoned by
Danes and Anglo-Saxons—having long been a
trouble to the Kings of Wessex, Edgar divided
the earldom. He made Oswulf Earl of the
country beyond the Tees—including the present
county of Northumberland; and Osla, Earl of
Deira, where the Danes had ruled, with York for
his chief town; but the Danes were allowed to
live peaceably under their own laws. And
Edgar granted Lothian, containing the counties
of Linlithgow, Edinburgh, and Haddington, to
Kenneth, King of Scots, to be held under himself.
And thus Lothian was ever after held by the
Scottish Kings, and its English speech became
the official language of Scotland. With Strathclyde,
west of the Solway, under a Scottish prince,
the map of the Kingdom of Scotland was now
broadly traced out.</p>

<p class='c006'>Edgar commuted the annual Welsh tribute to
300 wolves’ heads.  He appointed standard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>weights and measures, maintained an efficient
fleet, and was altogether a fine example of a man
who—although of small stature and mean
presence—by vigour of mind and will, ruled ably
and well in rude times. He was really <i>Basileus</i>,—lord-paramount
of all Britain. After his
coronation at Bath, which was not before he had
reigned thirteen years—he sailed with his fleet
round the western coasts. Coming to Chester, it
is related that eight Kings, viz.: Kenneth of
Scotland, Malcolm of Cumberland, Maccus of the
Western Isles, and five Welsh princes did
homage to him. They are said to have rowed
him in a boat on the Dee—he steering—from the
palace of Chester to the minster of St. John,
where there was solemn service; and then they
returned in like manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>But these halcyon days for England of peace
and settled government ended with Edgar. He
died in 975, leaving two sons—Edward by a first
wife—Ethelred by a second. Edward succeeded,
but reigned only four years, being assassinated at
the instigation of his step-mother, who desired
the crown for her son. Edward was in
consequence styled <i>The Martyr</i>. Ethelred was
named <i>The Unready</i>. He was weak, cowardly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>and thoroughly bad; his long reign of thirty-eight
years, was one duration of wretchedness
and confusion. He had hardly begun to reign
when the foreign Danes began to be troublesome,
and this time it was a farther stage of invasion:
they meant not plunder or partial settlement, but
conquest!</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first quarter of this tenth century, the
Northmen had taken possession of a large
district on the north of France. Their leader,
Rolf Ganger, became a Christian—or at least was
baptized as such,—married the daughter of
Charles the Simple, King of the West Franks,
and was, as Duke of Normandy, confirmed in
his possessions—a territory on either side of
the Seine, with Rouen for its capital. And
after this, the Danes and other Northmen, in
their expeditions against England, had assistance
from their kinsfolk in Normandy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ethelred tried first to bribe the Danes to leave
him in peace; and for the money for this purpose
he levied the first direct tax imposed upon
the English nation. It was called Dane-gild,
and amounted to twelve pence on each hide of
land, excepting lands held by the clergy. But
the idea was a vain one, for whilst the tax was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>vexatious, the pirate-ships still swarmed along
the English shores. In 1001, the Danes, under
King Sweyn, attacked Exeter, but were repulsed
by the citizens. Then—beating an English
army—they ravaged Devon, Dorset, Hants., and
the Isle of Wight; loading their ships with the
spoils. Next year Ethelred gave them money;
but finding this of no use, he devised the mad
and wicked scheme of ordering a general massacre
of the Danes residing in England. On St.
Bryce’s Day this massacre, to a large extent,
took place; it included aged persons, women, and
children. Gunhild, a sister of Sweyn’s, was one of
the victims. Burning for revenge, Sweyn again
invaded England. Exeter he now took and
plundered, and again marched eastwards through
the southern shires. He was generally successful,
for there was treason and incompetency amongst
the English leaders; and the unpopularity of
Ethelred was a down-drag on the English cause.
Year after year, Sweyn’s fleets appeared on the
fated coasts, and the Danes marched farther and
farther inwards. Through East Anglia they
went into the heart of England, burning Oxford
and Northampton.</p>

<p class='c006'>In August, 1013, Sweyn sailed up the Humber
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and Trent to Gainsborough. Here he had submission
made to him of the Earl of Northumbria,
and of the towns of Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham,
Stamford, and Derby. He then marched to
Bath, where the western Thanes submitted to him,
and then London submitted. Ethelred and his
queen fled to Normandy, Emma, the Queen, being
the Duke’s sister, and Danish Sweyn was virtually
King of England. But he did not long enjoy his
conquest; early in 1014 he died at Gainsborough.</p>

<p class='c006'>Canute, the son of Sweyn, was a man of strong
will, and he had already achieved warrior renown:
but he had a severe struggle before he secured his
father’s conquests. First, after Sweyn’s death,
the Witan, after extorting promises that he would
now govern rightly, recalled King Ethelred.
Receiving better support, and his son Edmund,
named Ironside, being an able commander, he
defeated Canute, who had to take to his ships.
Then Ethelred died, and Canute returned.
There was much fighting,—London being twice
unsuccessfully assaulted by the Danes,—and then
the rival princes, Edmund and Canute, had a
conference on a little island in the Severn.
They agreed to a division of the kingdom,—the
Saxon district to be south,—and the Danish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>district to be north of the Thames. A few
weeks after the treaty, Edmund died, and although
he left a young son Edward, Canute became sole
monarch. For twenty-four years,—1017 to 1041,—England
was under Danish rule. Canute
married Emma, the widow of King Ethelred, and
he further tried to win over his English subjects
by sending home all Danish soldiers, except a bodyguard
of 3000 men. Besides England, he ruled
over the three Scandinavian kingdoms in the
north, and is said to have exacted homage from
Malcolm, King of Scotland, and his two under-kings.
He was the first Danish King who professed
Christianity. He introduced the faith into
Denmark, and himself made a pilgrimage to Rome.
He reigned nineteen years, dying in 1036.</p>

<p class='c006'>After Canute’s death, the Witan divided
England into two portions. The counties north of
the Thames, including London, were assigned to
Harold, a son of Canute by his first wife; and the
district south of the river to Hardicanute, his son
by Emma. Harold died in 1039, and Hardicanute
became sole King. He died two years later, and
before he was buried, his half-brother Edward,
the son of Ethelred and Emma, and thus a
descendant of Alfred, was chosen King.</p>

  <h2 id='ch06' class='c004'>The Last Two Saxon Kings of England.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>A notable personage, Earl Godwin, was
the chief influence in this reversion to the
old race. Who was Earl Godwin? In 1020,
Canute, having come to trust his English subjects,
and wishing to mix the two nations in the
administration of affairs, created Godwin Earl of
the West Saxons. He was an able administrator,
an eloquent speaker, of high courage, and these
qualities generally exerted for the freedom and
independence of his country; and he came to
have the greatest personal influence of any man in
England. Little is known with certainty of his
birth, but he married Gytha, the sister of Ulf, a
Danish Earl, who had married a sister of Canute,
and whose son, Sweyne, became after the death
of Hardicanute, King of Denmark. Godwin had
several children, all of whom occupy conspicuous
places in the history of this eleventh century; the
second son, Harold, being the last of the Saxon
Kings of England.</p>

<p class='c006'>Earl Godwin became the King’s chief minister,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>and the King married his daughter Edith.
The King lived an ascetical, monkish life, and
they had no children. Edward had been born in
England, but on the deposition of his father
Ethelred, his mother Emma took him to the court
of her brother Robert, Duke of Normandy; and
he had lived there through the reigns of Canute
and Harold, coming back to England with
Hardicanute. He was thus thoroughly Norman-French
in his speech and his manners,—very fond
of his young cousin, Duke William, and he now
gathered French people about him, and promoted
them to office and estate. The French language
and fashions prevailed at Edward’s court; and in
this language lawyers began to write deeds, and
the clergy to preach sermons. These foreign
modes, so different from the English, gave great
displeasure to the old nobles; and Earl Godwin—although
three of his sons had been advanced to
earldoms—rebelled against the King’s authority.
After some fighting, the Earl’s army deserted him
at Dover, and he had to seek refuge in Flanders.
His daughter, the queen, was deprived of her
lands, and sent to a nunnery of which the King’s
sister was abbess.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the outbreak of the revolt, Edward asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>aid from William; the aid was not required, but
William, then twenty-three years of age, came,
with a retinue of knights to his cousin’s court.
They were hospitably entertained, and it is said
that the King promised to bequeath his crown to
William.</p>

<p class='c006'>Things did not go on well during Godwin’s
absence, so when, in 1052, he and his sons
appeared with a fleet in the Channel, there was
an under-current of mutiny in the King’s ships
under their French commanders. “Should
Englishmen fight with and slay Englishmen,
that outlandish folks might profit thereby?” So
the King had to take Godwin back into his
honours and estates: but he died next year,
leaving to Harold his titles, and his place as
foremost man in England.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now the dangers of a disputed succession
loomed over England. The Witan advised
Edward to send for Edward, the son of Edmund
Ironside, then an exile in Hungary. Edward
came with his family—a son Edgar, and three
daughters: but he died shortly after his arrival.
About this time Harold was shipwrecked on the
Norman coast; William kept him prisoner for
some time, and under circumstances of fraud and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>chicanery, an oath was extorted from him to
favour William’s pretensions to the English
throne. Edward died on 5th January, 1046, at
the age of 65. He was buried next day in
Westminster Abbey, which he had built. There,
in the centre of the magnificent pile, is his shrine,
for, about a century after his death, he was
canonised, and awarded the title of <i>Confessor</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now, who was to be chosen King of
England? For a choice had to be made.
Edgar the Atheling was quite young, and was
hardly English—having been born and brought
up in a foreign land; so, in these unsettled times,
he was not thought of. The Witan were obliged
to do what had never previously been done in
English history, and has never been done since
(except partially, in the case of calling William of
Orange to reign jointly with his wife Mary),—to
choose a King not of the blood royal.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it was not a difficult choice. Amongst the
nobles of England, one man, Harold, stood
foremost, both in strength of position and in
personal qualifications. He had now for years
been the chief administrator—a born ruler of men—energetic
yet prudent—valiant without ferocity;
and he had been the later recommendation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Edward as his successor. So, on the very day of
Edward’s burial, Harold was crowned in the same
Abbey, King of England.</p>

<p class='c006'>Harold’s troubles began almost from the day of
his coronation. William sent demands for the
crown; Edward had promised it to him, the
King’s nearest of kin, and Harold had sworn
over concealed relics, to help him to it. It was
replied that the crown was not disposable by
Edward; all he could do was to recommend a
successor to the Witan; and this he had done in
favour of Harold: Edward’s kinship to William
was on the maternal side, not on that of the
blood-royal of England: and as to Harold’s oath,
it was extorted by force and fraud, and was
entirely <i>nil</i> in that it pledged Harold to do what
he had no right to do,—the diversion of the
crown from the will of the English people.
William stormed and threatened, and, in building
ships and organising troops, made active preparations
for the invasion of England.</p>

<p class='c006'>Harold set about preparations for the defence
of his kingdom. He spent the summer in the
south, getting ready a fleet and army. He had
to wait too long for William; provisions falling
short in the beginning of September, he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>to disband the most of his troops. And meantime
another foe, and this one of his own house,
was intriguing against him—his brother Tostig.
Harold had given Tostig the earldom of Northumberland;
but he reigned so badly that the
people rose and expelled him,—Harold sanctioning
the expulsion. Tostig now went to
Harold Hardrada, the King of Norway, and
induced him to invade England. A fleet was
sent up the Humber; York was captured, and
there Harold Hardrada was proclaimed King.
But English Harold—hastily getting an army
together, met the invaders at Stamford Bridge; and
there, on September 25th, a fierce battle was fought,—ending
in victory for England; the Norwegian
King and the traitorous Tostig both being slain.</p>

<p class='c006'>But in meeting the Norwegian invasion, the
Anglo-Saxons lost England. Four days later,
William, with a banner consecrated by the Pope,
landed near Pevensey in Sussex. Harold was
seated at a banquet in York when the evil news
reached him. And now, the last in a life of
turmoil, Harold began his march through
England; collecting on his way what troops he
could, he reached the hill Senlac, nine miles from
Hastings, on the 13th of October. Here he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>marshalled his army—nearly all on foot—and
next day the Normans attacked him. It was a
well-contested fight; but discipline and knighthood
prevailed. The setting sun witnessed a routed
English army, its leader slain, and the Norman
William, conqueror of England.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The eleventh century, so momentous in English
history, was also an important one in the history
of Scotland. The Norse energy and ability to
rule shewed itself in the Earls of Orkney, who
dominated the Hebrides, and Ross, Moray,
Sutherland, and Caithness. About 1010, Earl
Sigurd married the daughter of King Malcolm II.
In 1014, Sigurd went over to Ireland, to aid the
Danish kings there against Brian Boru. In a
battle at Clontarf, the Danes were defeated—Sigurd
being slain—and the Celtic dynasty was
restored. Sigurd’s territories were divided
amongst two sons by a former marriage, and an
infant son, Thurfinn, by Malcolm’s daughter; to
the last was assigned the earldom of Caithness.
In 1018—taking advantage of the distracted state
of England in this, the first year of Canute’s reign—Malcolm
invaded upper Northumbria; by a
victory at Carham, near Coldstream on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Tweed, the Lothians were brought more under
his rule. But after Canute’s return from his
pilgrimage to Rome, he invaded Scotland, and
received the submission of Malcolm and two
under-kings, Mælbæthe and Jehmarc.</p>

<p class='c006'>Malcolm II. was succeeded by his grandson
Duncan,—a daughter’s son by a secular abbot of
Dunkeld. Duncan’s right was disputed by his
cousin Thurfirm, who was now Earl of Orkney.
Duncan went north to check the advance of his
kinsman, and was defeated near the Pentland
Firth. But an invasion of Danes under King
Sweyn on the coast of Fife, and which was
probably made in aid of Thurfirm, was defeated
by Macbeth, an able general of Duncan’s, and
who, it is said, was also a grandson of Malcolm’s,
by another daughter. Duncan was <em>probably</em>—as
in Shakespeare’s great drama—killed by Macbeth.
Certainly, to the exclusion of Duncan’s two sons,
Malcolm and Donaldbane, Macbeth seized the
crown. He reigned seventeen years—1040 to
1057—being contemporary with the Confessor,—a
glowing description of whom, posing as a saint
with miraculous powers of healing, occurs in
Shakespeare’s play. When, on the return of Earl
Godwin from exile, there was a general exodus of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>the Normans, whom Edward had placed in high
positions, many of them went to Scotland, and
were well received by Macbeth. He appears
historically, in spite of our great poet’s portraiture
of him, to have been an able monarch; and he
might be said to represent Celtic supremacy in
Scotland, as against the tendency to subvert it by
Anglo-Saxon alliances. Duncan had married the
daughter of Siward, Earl of Northumbria, and
Macbeth had to resist the attacks of Siward on
behalf of his grandson Malcolm. Malcolm
spent his boyhood in Cumbria, and his youth at
the court of the Confessor. He appealed to
Edward for help to gain his father’s throne, and
by an English army under Siward, and Macduff,
the powerful Thane of Fife, and Tostig, the son
of Earl Godwin, Macbeth was overthrown and
slain.</p>

<p class='c006'>Malcolm III., named Canmore—“big-head”—reigned
thirty-five years, 1058 to 1093. The
Norman victory at Hastings brought to the
Scottish court, then at Dunfermline, a number of
English refugees—these were a leaven of higher
culture and refinement amongst the rude thanes
and chieftains, and tended to further the advance of
civilization, of letters and the arts of life, throughout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>the northern kingdom. And numbers of Normans
also came and took service under Malcolm—and
thus it came about that not only in England, but
in Scotland also, most of the noble families have
in them a strain of Norman blood.</p>

<p class='c006'>Amongst the refugees were Edgar Atheling
and his sisters, grand-children of Edmund
Ironside. Malcolm married Margaret, the eldest
sister; she was a noble woman, learned, pious,
and charitable, doted upon by her husband, and
ever influencing his fierce nature for good. Thus
connected by birth with the heir of the old race
of English Kings, Malcolm invaded Northumberland
on behalf of Edgar; but William was too
strong for him, and in turn invaded Scotland.
William marched as far north as Abernethy,
where he forced Malcolm to do him homage.
William never really subjugated Northumbria
north of the Tyne, but built Newcastle as a
border fortress. After the death of William in
1087, Malcolm made other invasions of Northumbria,
and to consolidate the possession of
Lothian, he removed the seat of government
to Edinburgh. In 1093, he made a desperate
attempt to gain the counties of Northumberland
and Cumberland; but, whilst besieging the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>border fortress of Alnwick, he was attacked,
defeated, and killed by a Norman army.</p>

<p class='c006'>The marriage of Henry, the youngest son of
the Conqueror, with Matilda, daughter of Malcolm,
and niece of Edgar Atheling, united the Norman
and the older English royal lines. Henry’s son
William was, in 1120, drowned in “The White
Ship,” and his only other child, Maud, was thus the
rightful heir to the throne. But the proud
Norman barons had not been used to female rule;
so, after Henry’s death, in 1135, Stephen, a son of
the Conqueror’s daughter Adela, was made King.</p>

<p class='c006'>David I., youngest son of Malcolm Canmore,
succeeding his two elder brothers, was at this
time King of Scotland, and he took up the cause
of his niece Maud. In 1138 he invaded Northumberland,
penetrating into Yorkshire. At
Northallerton he was met and defeated in a battle
called “Of the Standard.” It is said that he was
gaining the day, when an English soldier cut off
the head of one of the slain, placed it on a spear,
and called out that it was the head of the King of
Scots, thus causing a panic in the Scottish army
which the King, riding amongst it without his
helmet, vainly tried to overcome. After peace,
David was allowed to retain Northumberland and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Durham, excepting the fortresses of Newcastle
and Bamborough. He was so good a king that
after his death, in 1153, he was canonised.</p>

<p class='c006'>David was succeeded by his twelve years old
grandson, Malcolm. He was, from his gentle
disposition, called <i>The Maiden</i>. He was greatly
attached to the English King, Henry II.,
accompanying him to France as a volunteer in his
army. Malcolm’s Scottish subjects were afraid of
the influence of the older sovereign. Homage
rendered by the Scottish kings for their
possessions in England, was always liable to be
construed into national homage; and it was
notified that Malcolm had gone beyond mere
homage, and had absolutely resigned these
possessions. So Malcolm had a strong message
from Scotland, asking him to return; this he did,
was again in favour with his people, but died in
1165, being then only twenty-four years old.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was succeeded by his brother William.
He was called <i>The Lion</i> because he used as his
armorial bearing a red lion—<i>rampant</i>—that is in
heraldry, standing upon its hind legs; and this
has ever since been the heraldric cognizance of
Scottish royalty. In 1174, for the recovery of his
ancestral possessions in Northumberland, William
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>invaded England. One day riding in a mist with
a slender retinue, he came upon a body of four
hundred English horse. At first he thought that
this was a portion of his own army; seeing his
mistake he fought boldly, but was overpowered
and made prisoner. He was taken to Northampton
and conducted into King Henry’s presence,
with his feet tied together under his horse’s belly.
Now Henry had just been to Canterbury doing
penance at the tomb of the murdered Thomas à
Becket; he had walked barefoot through the city,
prostrated himself on the pavement before the
shrine, passed the whole night in the church, and
in the morning had himself scourged by the priests
with knotted cords. And now, as a token that
his penance had reconciled him to heaven, and
obtained the saint’s forgiveness, here was his
enemy, the King of Scots, delivered into his
hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>Henry shewed no generosity towards his
captive. He demanded to have homage paid him
as Lord Paramount of Scotland. In his prison,
first at Richmond, and then at Falaise in
Normandy, William’s spirit was so far broken
that he acceded to Henry’s demands, and the
Scottish parliament, to obtain the release of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>king, ratified a dishonourable treaty. At York
the required homage was publicly paid; and for
fifteen years it continued in full force. But in
1189, Henry’s son, Richard, the Lion-hearted, on
the eve of his crusade to the Holy Land,—desirous
to place his home affairs in safety during
his absence, renounced the claim of general
homage extorted from William,—reserving only
such homage as was anciently rendered by
Malcolm Canmore.</p>

<p class='c006'>And in almost unbroken peace between the two
countries for upwards of a century, the generous
conduct of Richard bore good fruit. Then a
course of accidents, which nearly extinguished the
Scottish royal family, gave an English monarch
the opportunity for reviving old pretensions to
supremacy, and was thus the cause of renewed
wars and national animosities.</p>

<p class='c006'>William died in 1214, and was succeeded by
his son, Alexander III. He reigned thirty-five
years, and being of good parts, and with
considerable force of character, did much for the
progress of Scotland in the arts of civilization.
He was succeeded in 1249 by his son, Alexander
III., then only eight years of age. He married
the daughter of Henry III., but the children of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the marriage died young. The chief trouble of
his reign was from Norwegian invasions, but in
1263 Alexander defeated Haco, King of Norway,
at Largs, at the mouth of the Firth of Clyde.
By this victory Scotland obtained possession of
the Hebrides and the Isle of Man. Alexander
was accidentally killed in 1263; riding too near
the edge of a cliff on the Fifeshire coast, near
Kinghorn, in the dusk of the evening, his horse
stumbled and threw him over the cliff.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c004'>How Scotland became a Free Nation.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>We are not attempting to present a detailed
history of Scotland: such a history has
both a general and a national value, and there has
been no lack of writers of ability to give to it their
best of thought and of research. But as having
been a supreme crisis in this history, and as
having placed Scotland high on the list of free
nations, we give a brief summary of events at the
end of the thirteenth and beginning of the
fourteenth century.</p>

<p class='c006'>The English King, Edward the First, who has
been called the greatest of the Plantagenets, was
led to undertake the conquest of Scotland. He
found that insurgent spirits amongst his own
subjects therein found refuge, and that France—the
natural enemy of England—was generally
in alliance with Scotland. His designs on
Scotland had three separate phases. First:
King Alexander the Third of Scotland having
died without immediate issue, the crown devolved
upon his grand-daughter, Margaret, daughter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Eric, King of Norway. The young princess is
called in history the Maid of Norway. Edward
proposed a marriage between her and his own
eldest son, also named Edward. A treaty for this
marriage was entered into. It was one of the
might-have-beens of history; had it taken place,
and been fruitful, the union of the crowns might
have been anticipated by over three centuries,
and the after-histories of the two countries very
different. But on her voyage to take possession
of her crown, Margaret sickened; she landed at
Orkney, and there died, September, 1290.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then there were various claimants to the
crown, the rights of the claimants dating back
several generations. All having their partizans,
and anarchy and conflict appearing imminent, it
was agreed that Edward should be arbitrator.
He here saw an opening for the revival of what
might now have been thought the obsolete claim
of the English sovereign to be recognised as
Lord Paramount of Scotland. Two of the
candidates, Robert Bruce, Lord of Annandale,
and John Baliol, Lord of Galloway, were found
to be nearer in blood to the throne than all the
others. Both of them traced their descent from
daughters of David, Earl of Huntingdon, brother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>of King William, called <i>The Lion</i>. Edward gave
his decision in favour of Baliol, as being
descended from the elder daughter; but he
declared that the crown was to be held under him
as feudal superior; and Baliol did homage to
Edward as to his lord sovereign, and was
summoned as a peer to the English Parliament.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/image074.jpg' alt='EDWARD I' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>EDWARD I.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Edward soon shewed that his claim was not to
be a merely formal one; he demanded the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>surrender of three important Scottish fortresses.
Baliol would himself have submitted to this
arrogant demand, but at the instigation of the
nobles he sent a refusal, and a formal renunciation
of his vassalage. In a war which in 1294 broke
out between France and England, Scotland allied
itself with France. Then Edward assembled a
powerful army and invaded Scotland. He
gained a victory near Dunbar, and made a
triumphant march through the Lowlands. The
country was divided within itself; the powerful
Bruce faction was arrayed against that of Baliol.
Baliol made a cringing submission to Edward;
and Bruce sued for the nominal throne, as
tributary sovereign of Scotland. “Think’st thou
I am to conquer a kingdom for thee?” was
Edward’s stern reply; and he forthwith took
measures to make evident his purpose of keeping
Scotland to himself. He appointed an English
nobleman his viceroy, garrisoned the fortresses
with English troops, and removed to London the
regalia and the official records of the Kingdom,
and also the legendary stone upon which the
Scottish Kings had sat on their coronation. It
was the very nadir in the cycle of Scottish history.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then came revolts, with varied measures of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>success. A notable hero, Sir William Wallace,
whose name yet lives in Scottish hearts as the
very incarnation of patriotism and courage, took
the leadership in an all but successful insurrection.
But the larger, better appointed, and better
disciplined armies of Edward again placed
Scotland under his iron heel. Brave Wallace
was, through treachery, taken prisoner, carried up
to London, and tried for treason at Westminster
Hall. “I never could be a traitor to Edward,
for I was never his subject,” was Wallace’s
defence: the English judges condemned him to a
traitor’s death. With the indignities customary
in these semi-barbarous times, he was executed
on Tower Hill, 23rd August, 1305.</p>

<p class='c006'>Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick, a grandson of
the Bruce who was Baliol’s rival for the Crown,
had been one of Wallace’s ablest lieutenants.
He had a fine person, was brave and strong, was
moreover prudent and skilful, fitted to be a leader
of men, both in the council and on the battle-field.
He had the faults of his times—could be
passionate, and in his passion cruel and relentless.
He now aimed at the sovereignty, and within a
year of the death of Wallace, had himself, with a
miniature court and slender following, crowned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>King at Scone. When Edward heard of this he
was exceedingly wroth, and would himself again
go into Scotland and stamp out all the embers of
rebellion. In 1307, he did accompany an army
through Cumberland, to within three miles of the
Scottish border. But ruthless and determined in
spirit, he was now old and feeble in body, and</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hate and fury ill-supplied</div>
      <div class='line'>The stream of life’s exhausted tide.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>He was stricken by mortal sickness and died,
6th July, 1307. Before he died he made his son
promise to carry his unburied corpse with the
army until Scotland was again fully conquered.
The Second Edward did not carry out that
savage injunction, but had his father buried in
Westminster Abbey, where his tomb styles him,
with greater truth than is found in many monumental
inscriptions, “The hammer of Scotland.”</p>

<p class='c006'>For years Bruce was little other than a guerilla
chief, sometimes even a fugitive, hiding in highland
fastnesses, or in the Western Isles. He was under
the pope’s excommunication, for that in a quarrel
within the walls of a consecrated church in
Dumfries he had slain Sir John Comyn, who had
also certain hereditary claims to the throne.
But he was possessed of wonderful perseverance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Edward II. had, by the withdrawal of his father’s
great army of invasion, encouraged the Scottish
hopes of independence. In different parts of the
country there were partial insurrections against
English rule and English garrisons. In March,
1313, by a sudden <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>coup</i></span>, Edinburgh Castle was
taken. Gradually the greater number of the
Scottish nobles, with their retainers, declared for
Bruce. By the early spring of 1314, all the
important towns except Stirling had passed out of
English possession; and it was to be given up
unless relieved before midsummer.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such a state of things would not have come
about in the days of the elder Edward, before he
would have been with an army in Scotland, to
drive back the tide of insurrection. Now,
instigated by his counsellors to save Stirling,
Edward the Second assembled one of the largest
armies which had ever been under the command
of an English King. One hundred thousand
men are said to have crossed the Scottish border,
the flower of English chivalry—the best trained
archers in the world—soldiers from France, Welsh
and Irish, a mighty host. Bruce with all his
efforts could not bring into the field more than
one disciplined soldier for every three such in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>enemy’s ranks; but there were many loose
camp-followers, half-armed and undisciplined, who,
if their only aim was plunder, could yet harass
and cut off stragglers of an army on the march.
Bruce himself was a consummate general,
possessing the entire confidence of his men; he
had the choice of his ground, and he had as
lieutenants his brave brother Edward, his nephew
Randolph, and his faithful follower Lord James
Douglas, all commanding men with whom they
had in previous hard fights stood shoulder to
shoulder and achieved victory.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the afternoon of the 23rd of June, 1314, the
mighty English host rolled on in splendid order,
towards the plain near Stirling, where Bruce,
taking every advantage of the ground, had posted
his army. In the evening there were a few
skirmishes, and the Bruce had a personal encounter
with, and slew an English knight, De Bohun.
Such an act—if it could have been honourably
avoided—was not generalship, but in those days
personal prowess in the field was an essential for
leadership.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the next morning, before daybreak, the
battle began, it is named “of Bannockburn,” from
a small stream, the Bannock, on the right of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Bruce’s position. We have no need to say that,
despite of numbers and discipline being on the
side of the English, and courage a common
quality in both armies, it was a decisive Scottish
victory. The causes of this result are not far to
seek; Bruce was the better general, and he had a
position from which he could bring a superior
force to bear upon any single point of attack.
The course of the English cavalry lay through
morass and broken ground; and by pitfalls and
barriers, Bruce had made this ground more
difficult and dangerous. He closed at the earliest
possible moment with those terrible foes at a
distance—the English archers; his object was to
throw the enemy into confusion at some one point,
knowing how such confusion spreads itself. The
very numbers of the English told against their
united action—more than the half of them were
never actually engaged in the fight. And when
some early advantages showed in favour of the
Scots, their motley crowd of camp followers
thought that victory was assured, and, eager for
plunder and revenge, they burst down the slopes
with wild shouts and gesticulations. And thus a
partial confusion in the English ranks became a
general panic, a rout, and a “save-himself-who-can”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>flight from the field. With the Douglas in
hot pursuit, Edward rode across the country to
Dunbar, where he found a small vessel by which
he sailed to England.</p>

<p class='c006'>And thus—by one day’s devoted patriotism, by
steady valour and skilful generalship, as Scottish
historians say,—by hap-hazard, stratagem, and
surprise, as others have alleged, Robert Bruce
secured his crown, and could now really be called
<i>Rex Scotorum</i>, King of Scots. And Scotland
itself rose, by that day’s event, from the dust
of conquest and depression into a free and
independent state, to be governed by its own laws
and ruled by its own princes. There have been
since that day some disastrous Scottish defeats by
English arms, and Scotland has often felt itself
in the shadow of a superior power; but the halo
of Bannockburn has never been obscured. It
was not only a glorious day for Scotland, but an
auspicious one for England also; the Scottish
people could, after a preliminary union of the two
crowns in a sovereign common to both countries,
frankly, and on equal terms, join with England in
a national union; together, hand in hand, going
down the stream of history; in weal and in woe
standing by and aiding each other.</p>

  <h2 id='ch08' class='c004'>Scotland in the Two Hundred Years following Bannockburn.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>Never in all its previous history had
Scotland been so united within itself, or
held so important a place amongst other nations,
as during the reign of Robert Bruce.</p>

<p class='c006'>In what are called the dark ages of Europe,
feudalism was a general institution amongst the
western nations. The Conqueror introduced this
phase of society into England; and it soon
thereafter spread into Scotland, where clanship
had been its forerunner. Under the feudal
system, the King was chief; the land of the
nation was nominally his, to bestow in large
estates on the nobles and great barons; these
became his vassals, under tenure obligations to do
him homage, to take part, with their retainers, in
his wars, and to attend and take part in the
Great Councils which he summoned. The lesser
barons, or fief-holders met in their districts or
shires, and chose from amongst themselves
deputies or representatives. And the Great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Council contained besides, representatives of the
clergy, and of the chartered boroughs. In
England the national Council was divided into
two separate houses, namely, that of Peers, where
the members sat by personal right, and that of
Commons, who were members by representation.
In Scotland there was a single house: nobles and
prelates, representatives of shires, and delegates
from boroughs, all sat together, took a common
share in the debates, and all votes were of equal
account. Acts were made into law, and powers
were granted for raising money, by the bills
passed in Parliament, being assented to by the
sovereign. The form of assent was touching the
bills with the sceptre.</p>

<p class='c006'>And the old Scottish statute book is replete
with wise, well-considered laws. But from the
powers assumed by the nobles, each virtually
claiming absolute authority within his own
domains, the administration was woefully defective.
The nobles were, moreover, often engaged in
deadly feuds against each other; perpetuating
family quarrels through generations, and at
times powerful houses would coalesce against
sovereignty itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the English quarrels which arose, a Scottish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>army would be composed of brave and hardy
fighting men, trained to arms, and devoted to
their immediate leaders. But the leaders were
jealous of, and many of them inimical to each
other; so could not act in concert, and a battle
under such circumstances would be a disaster and
a disgrace. A great personality, like that of
Robert the Bruce, could over-master the discordant
elements, and make his own authority paramount;
but amongst his successors there were several
weak monarchs, unable to beat down personal
rancour and ambition in the council and in the
camp. And one great curse to Scotland in the
fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, was
the comparatively large number of regencies, from
the under ages of monarchs at their accession to
the throne,—thus creating jealousy, rivalry,
and partizanship amongst the more powerful
nobles.</p>

<p class='c006'>The burghs had risen in population and
importance, generally clustering round the larger
religious houses. Men not connected with the
land either as proprietors or retainers, congregated
together for mutual trade and mutual
protection. The sovereigns encouraged this
growth, as affording a readier means of raising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>revenue, and as an equipoise to the power of the
nobles; granting the towns chartered privileges,
which constituted them royal burghs. The
citizens elected their municipal Council; the chief
magistrate was styled Provost, the others Bailies.
Many burghs were defended by walling, and the
citizens were trained to arms; they had to defend
the burgh, and, in levies, to help the King in his
wars.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the midland shires law and order obtained
generally, but in the Highlands and their
adjacent islands, and in the frontier shires, there
was, as a rule, lawlessness and disorder. The
halo of romance, largely kindled by the genius of
Sir Walter Scott, hovers round the Scottish
Highlands. The</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Land of green heath and shaggy wood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Land of the mountain and the flood”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>bred a stalwart race of brave men, with persistent
loyalty in their hearts to their clanship, and to
the hills and glens which were to them their
fatherland; but they long continued in semi-barbarism,
separated by race and language from
the comparatively civilized Lowlands, with little
of national patriotism, and a great distrust of the—to
them distant—sovereignty of Holyrood.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>They often, as did their forefathers in the time of
the Romans, a thousand years previously, made
plundering incursions into the Lowlands; but
they had continual clan-quarrels amongst themselves,
which helped to keep them in their native
wilds, and the government would foment these
quarrels, and even, to their mutual destruction,
employ one clan against another. So late as the
reign of James IV. an Act of Parliament, for the
better government of the Highlands and Islands,
states that for want of justices and sheriffs, these
districts had become almost savage.</p>

<p class='c006'>And the border counties—on both sides of the
hardly defined line of demarcation—were also in
an unsettled state. They, too, had their family
clanships, their hereditary feuds, their predatory
raids. There was a sort of debatable land of
moor, forest, and morass, where neither national
nor forest-law was paramount. On both sides
Wardens of the marches were appointed, with a
mutual understanding to prevent border-raiding.
But the Wardens themselves were generally
heads of the great neighbouring families, and
they often broke their own laws, by sheltering or
encouraging offenders. Altogether the picture
which we gather from the history of Scotland in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries is not a
pleasant one to dwell upon.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there were rifts in the cloud. The first
James, 1406 to 1437, has left a noble record as a
man of knightly nature, a fine poet, and a wise
ruler. When eleven years of age, he was put by
his father, Robert III., on board of a vessel to
sail to France, to save him from his uncle, the
Duke of Albany, who had caused the death by
starvation of his elder brother. The vessel was
captured by the English, and the young prince
was for eighteen years a prisoner. But he was
well educated, and seems to have had great
freedom of movement—even taking part in the
French wars. He married Joan Beaufort,
daughter of the Earl of Somerset, and nearly
related to the royal family of England. In 1424,
a ransom was negotiated; James was set at
liberty, and he and his queen were crowned at
Scone. Under him many wise laws were
enacted for the proper administration of justice,
and for the fostering of home trade and foreign
commerce. His great task was in curtailing the
powers assumed by the nobles. This made him
enemies, and cost him his life. Temporarily
occupying a house in Perth, a band of miscreants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>under Sir Robert Graham, who had recently
been punished by the King for law-breaking,
burst at night into the King’s chamber, and
in his wife’s presence savagely slew him.
The Queen took wild vengeance on the
murderers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c004'>The Older Scottish Literature.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>Perhaps in no part of Scotland was there—even
in the fourteenth century—pure
Anglo-Saxon blood. The Lothians and the
south-eastern shires had been a portion of the
old kingdom of Northumbria, in which, with the
Angles as a normal population, there had been
large Danish settlements; and numbers of
Normans also settled therein, both before and
after the Conquest; whilst the descendants of
the old Britons had peopled the south-western
shires, from the Solway to the Clyde. Thus
whilst the generally spoken language of the two
countries was essentially the same, the literature
of England would be more purely Teutonic; that
of Scotland would include Celtic elements; but
these elements would assert themselves more in
qualifying the style of the literature than in the
use of Celtic words.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, Scottish poetry generally shows a
passionate love of Nature; its picturesque
descriptions and vivid colourings reaching or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>bordering upon exaggeration. Its humour is
broad, and of coarsish fibre. And then the
sentiment of patriotism has ever been more
pronounced in Scotland than in England. As a
rule, English Nationalism was, after the Norman
Conquest, even in the most disastrous times, safe
and self-assertive. On the other hand, Scottish
Nationalism was at one period, for a time,
entirely lost; it was often in extreme danger, and
was saved only by extreme efforts,—as we might
say, “by the skin of the teeth.” Can we wonder
then that fervid patriotism pervades,—becomes
obtrusive even, in Scottish literature; and that
this literature almost deifies the National heroes?</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, amongst the earlier efforts in Scottish
poetry replete with this glowing patriotism, we
have Archbishop Barbour’s poem, <cite>The Bruce</cite>;
Blind Harry’s <cite>History of Sir William Wallace</cite>;
and Andrew of Wyntoun’s <cite>Chronykil of Scotland</cite>.
We mentioned as a poet James I., he wrote <cite>The
Kings Quhair</cite> (<i>i.e.</i>, book); it is in Chaucer’s
seven-line stanza, and contains the best poetry
published in Great Britain, between that of
Chaucer and the Elizabethan period. From a
full heart he tells the story of his love; a love
which brightened his life, and shone true at his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>death, when his queen did her best to save him
from the daggers of the conspirators. The
King,—whilst a prisoner in Windsor Castle,—saw
from his window his future queen, walking in
an adjacent garden.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Another king, James Fifth of the name, was
also a poet; he may be called the originator of
that satirical humour in verse which afterwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>characterized so many Scottish poets, including
Robert Burns, the greatest of them all.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>WILLIAM DRUMMOND.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After the union of the crowns, and the removal
of the Scottish Court to London, in 1603, the old
language came to be considered a provincial
dialect. William Drummond, of Hawthornden
(1585-1649), was the first notable Scottish poet
who wrote well in modern English. He was
imbued with true literary taste and feeling, and
he ranks, as do subsequent Scottish writers,
amongst British authors.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>The Lowland folk-speech has really changed
less from the Old English than the tongue of any
other portion of the island; its glossary is very
largely a key to Chaucer and Spenser, to
Barbour and Andrew Wyntoun. As might have
been expected, the folk-speech which is nearest to
the English of modern literature is that of the
more remote Highlands, as of Inverness and its
surroundings. Where the old Gaelic has succumbed
to book-learned English, there was no
intermediate stage of the older tongue.</p>

<p class='c006'>That the Scottish tongue is a fitting vehicle for
pathos as well as for humour, scores of fine old
songs are in evidence. Allan Ramsay’s <cite>Gentle
Shepherd</cite>, a pastoral drama of the loves and lives
of the Scottish peasantry in the beginning of the
last century, is the best lengthy example we have
of every-day folk-speech. Burns never hesitated,
when it seemed to better suit his verse or his
meaning, to introduce modern English words;
Ramsay rarely does this. With Burns the
Scottish dialect as the expression of high-class
poetry, might well have ended; but it yet lingers
on, chiefly in humorous songs and descriptions.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c004'>The Reformation in England and in Scotland.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>In the progress of civilization, the middle of
the sixteenth century may be taken as the
turning point between the old past, with its
feudalism, its authoritative church, its restricted
culture, its antiquated science,—and the newer
order of things from which has sprung the ever-expanding
present. Since Guttenberg first used
moveable types, a century had so far perfected
his invention that books were becoming plentiful;
and the one which is morally and socially, as well
as religiously, the chief book in the world, had
been translated into the mother-tongue of
England. Towns were asserting their chartered
privileges. The telescope was ransacking the
heavens, and, for the first time, Magellan had
circumnavigated the globe. Cannon were used
in warfare, and iron had been smelted in
England. The newspaper had been born; and
Law was gradually gaining the ascendancy over
disorder and old prerogative.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>The Reformation of religion had established
itself in Central and Northern Europe, and was
now fighting its way in England and Scotland.
But the battle with Papal authority and its
dogmatic creeds was begun under very different
circumstances, was carried on by very different
methods, and had very different results in the two
neighbouring countries.</p>

<p class='c006'>How did the English Reformation come about?
During nearly forty years in the first half of the
sixteenth century (1509 to 1547) England was
ruled by the last of her really despotic kings,
Henry VIII. As everybody knows, Henry had
a peculiar domestic experience,—he married in
succession six wives. As fresh fancies took him,
he rid himself of four of these—two by divorce,
and two by the headsman’s axe. One wife, Jane
Seymour, died in childbirth of his only son, who
succeeded him as Edward VI. Wife No. 6,
by her extraordinary prudence contrived to escape
destruction, and survived the kingly monster.
<em>This</em> is a harsh term for the historical father of
the English church, and some modern historians
of ability and repute have done their best—as has
been done in the cases of Macbeth and Richard
III., as these kings are portrayed by Shakespeare—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>partially whitewash Henry. That he was, in
common parlance, a great king, and a man of
ability, of energy and decision, and that under
him England prospered, and held an advanced
position amongst the nations, few will dispute;
but that he was a cruel, lustful, selfish tyrant
seems equally undeniable. He made use of men
and women as subservient to his will or his
pleasure, and when his ends were so served, he
ruthlessly destroyed them. His great minister,
Wolsey, would not bend to his wishes in the
matter of divorcing his first wife, so Wolsey was
degraded, and in his old age sent into seclusion,
to die of a broken heart. And in succession
Thomas Cromwell, Sir Thomas More, and the
Earl of Surrey, suffered the fate of Anne Boleyn
and Catherine Howard.</p>

<p class='c006'>Henry, when a young man, opposed the Reformation.
He wrote a book against Luther and
his heresies, which so pleased the Pope that he
granted Henry the title of <i>Defender of the Faith</i>.
This papal title has passed down by inheritance
through all succeeding English sovereigns; every
coin from the mintage of Queen Victoria bears its
initial letters.</p>

<p class='c006'>Henry first married, under the Pope’s dispensation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the widow of his elder brother Arthur,
Catherine of Arragon, by whom he had a
daughter, afterwards Queen Mary. But the
King fell in love—if, in the passions of such a
man, the noble word <em>love</em> can be rightly used—with
Anne Boleyn, one of Catherine’s lady
attendants. To gain Anne, Henry, after a
number of years of wedded life with Catherine,
all at once became conscience-stricken that his
marriage with her was an unlawful one; and he
asked the Pope to recall his dispensation and
annul the marriage. Now, Catherine was sister
to the Emperor of Germany, Charles the Fifth,
one of the Pope’s best supporters in these sad
Reformation times. And, moreover, to have
rescinded the dispensation would have been an
admission of papal fallibility; so the Pope gave
Henry a refusal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Henry threw off his allegiance to the Pope,
and had himself acknowledged by Parliament as
the supreme head of the English Church.
Powerful, unscrupulous, and popular, he confiscated
church revenues, broke up monasteries,
and by Act of Parliament, in 1537, completed
politically the English Reformation. It was, so
far as the King was concerned, a reformation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>only in name, for as to liberty of conscience, and
the right of private judgment, he was as arrogant
a bigot as any pope who ever wore the tiara.
He vacillated in his own opinions, but enforced
those he held at the time by such severe enactments,
that many persons of both religions were
burned as heretics.</p>

<p class='c006'>And from the Anglican Church, so founded
on despotism and intolerance, can we wonder that
the shadow of Rome has never been thoroughly
lifted? In the abstract it is essentially a close
corporation of ecclesiastics, the mere people
hardly counting as a necessary factor. Its sacraments
have still miraculous or supernatural
properties attached to them; no one must
officiate therein who has not been <em>ordained</em>, and
the assumed powers of ordination came through
the Romish Church. From the older Church it
adopted certain creeds, as dogmatic in their
assertions, and intolerant in their fulminations,
as were ever Papal Bulls or Decrees of Councils.
Of course the mellowing influence of time, the
broadening thoughts of later years, and the
rivalship of Nonconformity, have done much to
take out old stings and deaden old intolerance;
whilst a cloud of witnesses for righteousness and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>progress in the Church itself, have raised it above
its old self, and brought it in nearer touch with
the spirit of the present age.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The history of the Scottish Reformation is an
entirely different one. Instead of being originated
and fostered by State authority, it was a fierce
and obstinate battle with such authority.
Scotland was then under one of its disastrous
regencies, that of Mary of Guise, the widow of
King James V., acting for her infant daughter
Mary, known afterwards in history as the
beautiful and unfortunate Queen of Scots. The
Reformation in England had sent a wave
of agitation into Scotland, and this wave
advanced strongly as refugees from the cruel
persecutions of Mary Tudor flocked into the
Northern Kingdom; and as the Regent, with her
coadjutor, the bigoted and relentless Cardinal
Beaton, also began to persecute the new faith,
and send its adherents to the stake; for it has
ever been found to be a true saying, “The blood
of the martyrs is the seed of the Church.” In
revenge for the burning, in 1545, of one of the
saintliest of men, George Wishart, a party of the
Reformers murdered the Cardinal in his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>castle of St. Andrews, from one of the windows
of which he had gloated over the martyr’s cruel
death.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1557, a number of the Reformers, including
several noblemen, and styling themselves the
Lords of the Congregation, entered into a mutual
bond or covenant, “To defend the whole congregation
of Christ against Satan and all his
powers; to have prayers made and the sacraments
administered in the vulgar tongue; in
worship to use only the Bible, and the Prayer-book
of Edward VI.” In 1559, the Regent,
who was entirely under French influence, and had
been gradually filling high offices with Frenchmen,
and accumulating French troops, issued a
proclamation, forbidding any one to preach or
administer the sacraments without the authority
of the bishops.</p>

<p class='c006'>And at this period a sterling man fitted to be
a leader in such turbulent times, John Knox,
appears in the forefront of the conflict. He had
been college-bred, and became a priest, but
adopted the Reformation in its Calvinistic phase,
and, as he had opportunity, disseminated the new
tenets with eloquence and zeal. After Beaton’s
death, his slayers, with others, and Knox amongst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>these, held out the castle of St. Andrews for
fourteen months, but had to yield at last to their
French besiegers, and were sent prisoners to
France. Knox had to work in the galleys on
the river Loire. But again he is in Scotland,
preaching from place to place. After a powerful
sermon against idolatry in a church in Perth, a
priest began to celebrate mass. Heated by the
glowing words of Knox, the people broke the
images in the church. The Regent was very
wroth, she deposed the Protestant provost of the
city, and threatened it with French troops. The
Congregation raised troops and appealed to
Elizabeth, now on the English throne, for aid.
Elizabeth sent some troops, and there was
fighting with varied successes, until, by a treaty
made in Edinburgh, the French agreed to
abandon Scotland, and the Protestants were to be
allowed the free exercise of their religion. In the
Scottish Parliament of 1560 there was a solemn
abjuration of the Pope and the mass. And the
Geneva Confession of Faith was constituted the
theological standard of the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c006'>Differing from the English Church with its
orders, its episcopacy, and its sovereign headship,
the Scottish Reformers denied the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>authority of the sovereign, or secular government,
to interfere in the affairs of the Church; determining
that these affairs should be under the
direction of a Court of Delegates, the greater
number being chosen from the ministers, all of
whom were of the same standing and dignity,
and the remainder—with equal authority in the
deliberations—of a certain number of the laity,
called Elders, thus forming what is called “The
General Assembly of the Church.” The sacraments
were to be simple observances, spiritual
only as they were spiritually received. Church
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>edifices were regarded as merely stone and lime
structures, having no claims to special regard,
except during divine service. So to these
Reformers, defacing in the churches what had
been considered sacred statuary and ornamentation,
even to the sign of the cross, was deemed a
ready mode of testifying against Popish superstitions.
As to the abbeys and monasteries—“Pull
down the nests,” said stern John Knox,
“and the rooks will fly away.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus the Kirk of Scotland was essentially
democratic in its origin, and, although always
rigid and often intolerant, it has in the main
so continued. Its theological tenets, although
wordy and abstruse, were a whetstone to
the intellect, and helped to develope a serious and
thoughtful, a reading, and an argumentative
people. Shepherds meeting each other on the
hillsides, weavers with their yarn at the village
beetling-stone, would, like Milton’s angels:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'>“Reason high</div>
      <div class='line'>Of providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fixed fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The English Church, on the other hand, did not
encourage doctrinal discussion, but simple faith in
its articles, and obedience to its rubric.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>But—which we would hardly have expected from
its complex system of faith, and its niceties in
phraseology—the Presbyterian Kirk produced
zeal and earnest devotedness in the Scottish
people. Without ordination by a bishop, whose
orders were presumed to have come in direct
succession from the Apostles, the ministers were
held in high reverence and esteem; without
printed prayers its common members learned to
pray. It had its army of martyrs; except
amongst Puritan Nonconformists, the Scottish
Covenanters have hardly their English representatives.</p>

<p class='c006'>John Knox largely impressed the Reformed
Church with his own individuality. No doubt
he was rigid, and, to our modern ideas, narrow-minded
and intolerant. He would not have
accomplished the work he did if he had not himself
thoroughly believed in it, as the greatest
work which then needed to be done. He has
been blamed for speaking harsh words to Queen
Mary; but he had to speak what he felt to be
stern truths, for which honied words could hardly
fit themselves. Mary, accustomed to fascinate
the eyes and sway the wills of all who approached
her, demanded of Knox:—“Who are you who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>dare dictate to the sovereign and nobles of this
realm?” “I am, Madam,” answered Knox, “a
subject of this realm.” A subject, and therefore
a co-partner in the realm; to the fullest extent of
his knowledge and his capabilities responsible for
its right government; just as the Hebrew prophets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>claimed a right to stand before their kings, and,
not always in smooth words, to denounce sin and
hypocrisy, oppression, and backslidings from the
law of God.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>For supporting the introduction of bishops into
the Presbyterian Church, as impairing the
republican equality of its ministers, Knox had
bitterly rebuked the Regent Morton. But when,
in November, 1572, the Regent stood by the
grave of the Reformer, it was in a choking voice
that he pronounced the grand eulogium:—“There
lies he, who never feared the face of man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>At the era of the Reformation no translation of
the Scriptures had yet been printed in Scotland;
what copies in the vernacular had been brought
from England, were in the hands of the wealthy;
indeed few of the common people could then have
read them. The parish school as yet was not.
The old church had not encouraged inquiry into
the rationale of its dogmas, and although
theological discussion was in the air, it had not
penetrated into the lower strata of Scottish
society. And thus the popular outburst against
the old church was hardly founded on conscience
and conviction; in its beginnings at least, it was
more a revolution against priestly domination.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the cry of <em>idolatry</em> was raised. In the
destruction of images in the churches, the leading
reformers found the populace only too willing
agents. Even architectural ornamentation—without
religious significance—was removed or
destroyed, the capitals of pillars were covered
with plaster, the very tombs were rifled and
defaced. The parish church had been the nucleus
around which, for centuries, the veneration and
the spiritual thought of past times had revolved,
and now the idea of its “consecration” was to be
banished from the popular mind. The reformers
encouraged male worshippers to enter churches
with their hats on—uncovering during prayer,
psalm-singing, and scripture reading, and resuming
their hats when the minister gave out the text for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>his sermon. When the discourse touched a popular
chord, there was applause by clapping of hands
and stamping of feet. Rome had demanded
unquestioning submission to its authority,—an
unreserved veneration for its ritual; and in
breaking away from this bondage, the spirit of
reverence was largely impaired.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus to other religionists, the form of worship
in a Scottish church appeared bald and careless,
hardly decorous. There was no private prayer
on sitting down; in the public prayers, the
stubborn presbyterian knee did not bend,—all
stood upright, and the eyes would roam all over
the church. In singing the psalms, there was no
assistance from the swelling tones of an organ;
gloves were put on during the benediction, and
all were prepared for a hurried exit at its <i>Amen</i>.
Funeral sermons, and even tomb-stones, were
proscribed by the early reformers. One in King
James’s English retinue, accompanying him in a
visit to Scotland, remarked,—“The Scots
christen without the sign of the cross; they
marry without the ring; and bury without any
funeral service.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Although the old psalmist said,—“O sing unto
the Lord a new song,”—the Presbyterians did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>not seem to think that anything had occurred in
the following two thousand years, to incite to new
songs of praise and thanksgiving: so they
continued to sing only the Hebrew psalms. It
was not until 1745 that the General Assembly
authorized the use of Paraphrases,—that is,
metrical versions of other portions of Scripture,
but many congregations refused them. Now,
there are authorized hymnals—the organ is again
finding its place in the churches—and other
changes have come about, bringing the form of
service in nearer consonance with that of other
churches, and with the more ornate tendency of
the present times.</p>

  <h2 id='ch11' class='c004'>The Rival Queens—Mary and Elizabeth.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>Mary’s evil fortunes began with her birth.
Her dying father, heart-broken over a
disastrous battle, lived only a week after his
“poor lass,” as he called her, was born. Then
Henry VIII. of England saw in this infant niece
of his a means of uniting the two crowns, much
in the way by which a wolf unites itself with the
lamb it devours, by having a marriage contracted
between her and his only son, Prince Edward.
He sent negotiators to enforce, under threats, his
project. There was much opposition amongst the
Scottish nobility. It looked like surrendering
their country to England. They said to Henry’s
negotiators, “If your lad were a lass, and our lass
were a lad, would you then be so earnest in this
matter; and could you be content that our lad
should, by marrying your lass, become King of
England? No! your nation would never agree
to have a Scot for King; and we will not have an
Englishman as our King. And tho’ the whole
nobility of the realm should consent thereto, yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>the common people would rebel against it; the
very boys would hurl stones, and the wives handle
their distaffs against it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Henry was wroth exceedingly, threatened war,
and demanded the custody of the child-Queen.
To have him for an ally against the Queen-Regent
and her minister, the persecutor Beaton,
the Reformers temporized, and the Scottish
Parliament consented to the match; Mary to be
sent to Henry when she was ten years old.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the meantime Henry got embroiled with
France; and Scotland, under the influence of
the Queen-Regent, allied itself with that country.
Henry sent an army into Scotland. There were
some Scottish successes; but at Pinkie, in 1547,
the English general Somerset gained a complete
victory. Before this event Henry had died; but
his long cherished object, the possession of the
child of Scotland, was still pressed, and now
seemed on the point of attainment. But the
Scottish people were irritated and alarmed to
such a degree that they resolved to make the
projected marriage impossible, by marrying their
young mistress to the Dauphin of France, and
sending her to be brought up at the French
court. To this resolve Parliament gave a hasty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>assent; and in July 1548, the poor child, now in
her sixth year, accompanied by her four Maries—girls
her own age, of noble birth, her present
play-fellows and future companions—was shipped
off to France.</p>

<p class='c006'>Prince Edward, who succeeded Henry as
Edward VI., was twelve years of age when his
father died, and he reigned only four years.
Then there was the painful incident of Lady
Jane Grey being pushed forward by her
ambitious kindred as a claimant to the throne;
the venture being death to her and to them.
And then Henry’s daughter by his first wife
became Queen. A rigid Catholic, she at once
took steps, intolerant, relentless, and cruel, to
re-establish the old faith. The savage persecutions
of her reign have rendered it for ever
infamous. She goes down through all time as
the <i>Bloody</i> Mary. Smithfield blazed with the
fires of martyrdom; five Protestant bishops were
amongst the sufferers. Happily her reign was a
brief one, lasting only five years; and they were
for her years of domestic misery, her marriage
with the Spanish King, Philip II., being an
unhappy and unfruitful one.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her half-sister Elizabeth, the issue of Henry’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>marriage with Anne Boleyn, succeeded to the
throne in 1558. Elizabeth had been brought
up as a Protestant, had been kept a close prisoner
during Mary’s reign,—narrowly escaping being
herself a martyr. And now to maintain her
claims to the throne, she had to depend upon her
Protestant subjects; for the Catholics denied the
validity of her father and mother’s marriage, and
consequently denied her legitimacy and right to
reign. They asserted that Mary Stuart of
Scotland was the rightful heir, and as such
entitled to their allegiance.</p>

<p class='c006'>A brief explanation will show on what foundation
the Stuart claim—afterwards allowed at the
death of Elizabeth in favour of Mary’s son
James—was based. At Bosworth Field, Richard
III., of the house of York, was defeated and
slain. The victor was Richmond of Lancaster,
who thus became King Henry VII.; his son was
Henry VIII., and his daughter Margaret married
James IV., King of Scotland. The neighbouring
Kings, James and Henry VIII., were thus
brothers-in-law; none the less did they quarrel
and go to war with each other, their hostilities
ending, so far as James was concerned, with the
battle of Flodden. Henry was then engaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>in a war with France, and James was killed in
the battle which his vanity had provoked, and
which he generalled so badly. His son, James V.,
was Henry’s nephew, and full cousin to Henry’s
children, Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth. Thus,
failing direct legitimate heirs to the English
throne, James’s daughter Mary was, in virtue of
her descent as the grand-daughter of Henry VII.,
the nearest heir.</p>

<p class='c006'>At Elizabeth’s accession, in 1558, Mary was
sixteen years of age. As the wife of the
Dauphin of France, the French monarchy put
forward her claims as the rightful sovereign of
England, and even had a coinage struck with her
effigy thus designated. So Elizabeth feared and
hated Mary as her rival; hated her yet more,
with a woman’s spite, for her beauty and accomplishments.
Soon Mary, by his early death, lost
her husband, then King of France, and at nineteen
years of age, in the splendour of her queenly
beauty, she—regretfully for the land of her youth—returned
to her native Scotland.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTLAND.<br />(<i>From a painting by Zucchero.</i>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>By her sweet presence, her courtesy, and
winning manners, Mary largely gained the hearts
of her people; but murmurings soon arose about
her foreign ways, her foreign favouritisms, and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>fidelity to her Catholic faith. And a cloud gathered
over her domestic life. She had married a young
nobleman, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. He
was next to Mary in the hereditary line of
succession to the English throne—as Mary was a
grand-daughter of Margaret Tudor he was a
grandson—by Margaret’s second marriage with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>the Earl of Angus. He was also a Catholic.
Darnley seems to have been little other than a
handsome, but petulant, ill-behaved, and ill-mannered
boy, fitted, neither by intellect nor
disposition, to be the husband and life-companion
of such a proud, clever, and accomplished woman
as Mary. Mary refused him the crown-matrimonial,
and they very soon fell apart.
Mary was not forbidden to have her private
chapel; an Italian singer in this chapel, David
Rizzio, became a favourite, he acted as her
secretary, and was admitted into the inner circle
of Holyrood. One evening the supper-party was
broken in upon by Darnley and a number of his
associates, and Rizzio was dragged out to the landing,
and by several weapons barbarously stabbed
to death. Mary’s fair countenance and gentle voice
were mated with an iron will, persistent in carrying
out her hatreds to the death. Darnley was
murdered by a rude villain, Earl Bothwell, and
Mary has never been satisfactorily cleared of
complicity in the murder. Shortly afterwards she
married this Bothwell—by force, her apologists
say.</p>

<p class='c006'>We shall not even briefly go over the oft-told
tale of Mary’s after-life. As the incidents loom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>out of the tangled web, we feel, even through the
centuries, as if we would fain arrest them by a
warning voice, fain save that fascinating woman
from her doom. We feel a yearning pity, almost
akin to love, although stern justice gives her
blame as a woman, a wife, and a Queen. That
pitiful winter’s morning in Fotheringay Castle, in
1587, brought to Mary, by the headsman’s axe, a
cruel death, but also a kind release from captivity
and unrest.</p>

<p class='c006'>And what of her rival queen and kinswoman,
“that bright Occidental star,” Elizabeth? A
woman with a strong masculine intellect, of
dauntless courage, one fitted to rule and govern,
and advance a nation. But unmistakably her
father’s daughter, cruel, heartless, unforgiving,
and thoroughly false: with a woman’s caprice
exalting to supreme favouritism to-day, and
striking down into the dust to-morrow. She
signed Mary’s death-warrant, and, by grimaces
and plainest hints, she made her people slay her
own cousin. And when the deed was
irretrievably done she went into a hypocritical
paroxysm of well-acted anger and regret, and
dealt round punishment for the act which she
herself had compassed. These two women cited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>to the bar of judgment, Mary might well
hide her face for many sins and frailties; but
the better actor would try to stand up,
boldly and unabashed. Our own hearts must
answer which of the two we justify, rather than
the other.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Doubtless, as a picturesque town, Edinburgh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>stands in the foremost rank. The natural configuration
of the ground in ridges and hollows,
and the commanding prospects from its heights of
undulating landscape, of broad Frith, of distant
hills, and of the adjacent Arthur’s Seat, like a
couchant lion guarding the town, are striking, and
stir up any poetic feeling that may be lurking in
the heart. In the architecture there is a strange
and incongruous mingling of the modern and the
antique, of the genuine and the meretricious.
There are many interesting historical memorials,
and very many reminders of the everyday
present. Buildings and monuments bring
cherished and illustrious names to our mind; other
names are obtruded which we would gladly
forget. But no one can, from the Castle bastions,
see the panorama of the city and its surroundings,
without intense interest, and an admiration which
will abide in the memory.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 647, Edwin, the son of Ella, Saxon King of
Northumbria, extended his conquests beyond the
Forth. He re-fortified the rock-castle, called
Puellerum, and to the little town which
rose up around it, was given the name of
Edwinsburgh. In 1128, Edinburgh was made a
Royal burgh by David I. In 1215, a Parliament
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>of Alexander II. met here for the first time. In
1296, the title of the chief magistrate was
changed from Alderman to Provost.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1424, James I. was, at £40,000, ransomed
from his long and unjust imprisonment in
England: the towns of Edinburgh, Aberdeen,
Perth, and Dundee, guaranteeing the ransom.
James had, on his parole, been free to move
about England; and he soon saw how far behind
her his own land was in agriculture and commerce.
To amend this he made laws, which to us seem
meddlesome and going into petty details, but
doubtless were then useful and progressive. For
the prevention of fires in buildings it was
advisable to enact that “hempe, lint and straw
be not put in houses aboone or near fires,” and
that “nae licht be fetched from ane house to ane
uther but within covered weshel or lanterne.”
The lofty piles of buildings for which the older
town of Edinburgh is now remarkable, were in
the fifteenth century represented by wooden
houses not exceeding two stories in height; for
we find that in providing against fires, Parliament
ordained that “at the common cost aucht twenty-fute
ladders be made, and kept in a ready place
in the town, for that use and none other.” From
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the murder of James I. in Perth, in 1456,
Edinburgh dates as the capital, and where
Parliaments were exclusively held.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1496, in order to qualify the eldest sons of
barons and freeholders for exercising the functions
of sheriffs (holding judicial powers in a
Scottish county) and ordinary justices, it was
enacted that such be sent to grammar schools,
and there remain, “quhill they be competentlie
founded and have perfite Latin; and thereafter to
remain three zeirs at the schules of art and jure;
so that they may have knowledge and onderstanding
of the laws.” The population of Edinburgh
was then about 8,000.</p>

<p class='c006'>When, in 1503, Margaret, daughter of Henry
VII., came to Scotland as the bride of James IV.,
the King met her at Dalkeith, and the royal
lovers made their entry into Edinburgh, “the
Kyng riding on a pallafroy, with the princesse
behind him, and so through the toun.” Ten
years later came, on the 10th September, the sad
news of Flodden, fought on the previous day;
when the brave but fool-hardy King, and the
flower of Scottish manhood “were a’ wede away.”
At first it was consternation and the confusion of
despair; but soon order and new energy prevailed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Under pains of forfeiture of life and goods, all
citizens capable of bearing arms were convoked
to form, with the stragglers from Flodden, a fresh
army: the older citizens were to defend the city.
The women were, under a threat of banishment,
forbidden to cry and clamour in the streets; the
better sort were to go to church and pray for
their country; and thereafter to mind their
business at home, and not encumber the streets.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1543, under the regency of the Earl of
Arran, an Act was passed permitting the
scriptures to be read in the vulgar tongue, and
the Reformation ideas began to be bruited about.
Twelve years later, statues in St. Giles’ Church,
of the Virgin and certain saints were destroyed;
but the then Regent, Mary of Guise, by threatenings,
given strength to by her French troops,
contrived to keep down open revolt against the
old faith. But in 1558, on the festival day of
St. Giles, the patron saint of Edinburgh, and
for which festival the priests and monks had
made great preparation, it was discovered that
the image of the saint had been taken from the
church during the previous night, and thrown
into the North Loch. The priests got a smaller
statue from the Greyfriars, this the people called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>in derision “the bairn-saint.” The Queen-Regent
was in the procession. She must have
been a woman of strong character; in her
presence all went smoothly, but having left, the
populace tore the little St. Giles to pieces,
hustling and dispersing the priests.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the death of the Queen-Regent, and the
withdrawal of the French troops in 1560, the
Protestant cause was in the ascendancy. An Act
was passed denouncing Popery, and sanctioning
the hastily compiled Confession of Faith.
Penalties on Catholic worship, very similar to
those under which Protestants had groaned, and
which they had bitterly denounced, were imposed.
Any one celebrating mass or being present at its
celebration, was to be punished by forfeiture of
goods for the first offence, by banishment for the
second, and by death for the third. Queen
Mary, then in France, and her husband Francis,
who held from Mary the crown-matrimonial of
Scotland, refused to ratify the Acts, and insulted
the messenger of the Parliament.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next year, 1561, Mary, now a widow, and as
such having lost her high position at the French
court, returned to Scotland. She waited upon
the deck of the vessel which was taking her from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the land of her youth, until its shores faded from
her tear-dimmed eyes. “Farewell, beloved
France,” she sobbed, “I shall never behold thee
again.” When, on the first day of September,
she made her public entry into Edinburgh, never
had the city shown such an exuberance of warm
enthusiasm. The procession included all the
foremost citizens, Protestant and Catholic, clad in
velvet and satin; twelve citizens supporting the
canopy over the triumphal car, where, like an
Helen in her matchless loveliness, sat the young
Queen. When on the following Sunday she
attended mass at Holyrood, her Catholic servants
were insulted, and the crowd could hardly be
restrained from interrupting the service. And so
began the hurley-burley, through six years little
other than a civil war; a time of confusion, of
plotting and counter-plotting, of intolerance, of
malice and revenge; that fair figure with the
dove’s eyes, but also with a determined will and
an unswerving purpose, ever emerging into the
foreground, now an object of admiration, and
then for denunciation, but always for the highest
interest and the profoundest pity.</p>

<p class='c006'>After Marys enforced abdication in Lochleven
Castle, on 29th July, 1567, her year-old son
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>James was proclaimed King. The Earl of
Morton, head of the powerful Douglas family,
taking, in the child’s name, the usual coronation
oaths. Mary’s half-brother, the Earl of Murray,
became Regent. Three years later Murray,
whilst riding in State through Linlithgow, was
shot dead in revenge for a private injury.
Then followed two years of discord and confusion
from rival factions; and then, 1572, Morton
became Regent, and was the master-power
in the kingdom. For eight years he was the
controlling influence. He was haughty and
revengeful, and at the same time avaricious
and corrupt; so he made many enemies, and
these plotted his destruction. One day when the
King, now fourteen years of age, was sitting in
Council, one of James’s favourites entered the
chamber abruptly, fell on his knees before the
King, and accused Morton of having been
concerned in the murder of the King’s father,
Lord Darnley. Morton replied that instead of
having been in the plot, he had himself been
most active in dragging to light and punishing
the conspirators. He now demanded a fair trial;
but fair trials were not then general. Morton’s
servants were put to the torture to extort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>damnatory evidence, and several known enemies
were on the jury; so he was found guilty of
having been “art and part” in Darnley’s murder.
To the last he denied having advised or aided in
the foul deed; but it is probable that he knew
that it was in purpose. He suffered death by
decapitation at Edinburgh, in June, 1581, the
instrument of death being a rough form of
guillotine, called the <i>Maiden</i>, which, it is said, he
introduced into Scotland from Yorkshire. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>gruesome machine is now in the Edinburgh
Antiquarian Museum.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1596, James, now thirty years of age,
quarrelled with his capital. There was in all the
Stuart kings a strong strain of the old faith in
what hearts they had; or, there was at least a
very strong dislike of the independent, self-assertive
idea which was the basis of the Presbyterian
Church. James granted certain favours, which
we should now think simply common rights, to
his Catholic nobles, and this roused the ire of the
Kirk, then ever ready to testify against popery,
to assert for itself the right of free judgment in
religious matters, but practically to deny this
right to others. A standing <i>Council of the
Church</i> was formed out of Edinburgh and
provincial Presbyteries; inflammatory sermons
were preached, and the King, refusing to receive
a petition demanding that the laws against
papacy be stringently enforced, was mobbed, and
seditious cries were raised.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>JAMES THE SIXTH OF SCOTLAND AND FIRST OF ENGLAND.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>James hastily removed the Court to Linlithgow,
ordering the courts of law to follow him there;
and he ordered the magistrates to seize and
imprison the Council of Ministers as promoters of
sedition. The magistrates, anxious to regain the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>King’s favour, were preparing to obey him when
the ministers fled to Newcastle. The King’s
unwonted promptitude and decision, seem to have
borne down all opposition. On the 1st of
January, 1596-7, he re-entered Edinburgh
between a double file of guards, chiefly from the
wild Highland and border clans, which lined the
streets. The magistrates on their knees submitted
to him in most abject terms, and many of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the nobles pleaded for pardon. James was not a
large-minded man,—the more humble they, the
more inexorable he. He gave three of his lords
charge of the city, declaring that it had forfeited
all its corporate privileges, was liable to all the
penalties of treason, and deserved to be razed to
the ground. We learn that Elizabeth interceded
for the penitent city, which, deprived of its
magistrates, deserted by its ministers, and proscribed
by the King, was in the lowest depth of
despondency. James relented so far as to
absolve the city on the payment of a fine of
20,000 marks, and the forfeiture to the crown of
the houses of the recreant ministers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Elizabeth died in March 1603, and James was
at once proclaimed King of England, and warmly
invited to take up his residence in London. On
the Sunday previous to his departure he was
present at the service in St. Giles’ Church. At
the close of the service he rose and addressed the
congregation in a speech full of kindly expressions,
declaring his abiding affection and regard for his
native land; and the sighs and tears of the people
shewed how their hearts were moved by his
words.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fifteen years later, James was again in Edinburgh.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>His progress from Berwick was one
continued ovation. In every town which he
passed through, flattering panegyrics, in Latin
or Greek, were addressed to him. As he entered
Edinburgh by the West Port, he was met by the
magistrates in their robes, and the town-clerk
read a long address replete with compliments, so
inflated and exaggerative, that the dedication
to “the most high and mighty Prince James,” of
the authorised translation of the Bible, reads
comparatively flat and commonplace. Afterwards,
the king was sumptuously entertained, and presented
with 10,000 marks in a silver basin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Just at this time, the invention of logarithms,
by a Scotch laird, John Napier of Merchiston,
near Edinburgh, was becoming known in the
then comparatively restricted scientific world.
Logarithms are prepared tables of numbers, by
which complex problems in trigonometry, and the
tedious extraction of roots, can be performed by
the simpler rules of arithmetic. To the well-educated,
they save much time and labour; in
the art of navigation, they enable the mariner
who may be unskilled in mathematics, to work
out the most intricate calculations. In all vessels
on the open seas, when observations can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>taken, in all mathematical schools and astronomical
observatories, logarithms are in daily use. As
with other things, familiarity discounts our
wonder at their aptitude and value; but the
estimate by scientists of Napier’s invention is,
that it ranks amongst British contributions to
science, second only to Newton’s <cite>Principia</cite>.
Kepler regarded Napier as one of the greatest
men of his age; and in the roll of those who were
foremost in establishing real science in Europe,
his is the only name which can be placed
alongside the names of Copernicus, Tycho Brahe,
Kepler, and Galileo.</p>

<p class='c006'>The long sloping street called the Canongate,
which reaches down from the centre of the Old
Town to Holyrood, was, with its tributary lanes
and closes, created a Burgh of Regality by King
David the First. It was outside the walls of
Edinburgh, and had its own Council of Bailies,
Deacons of Trades, and Burgesses. The Canongate
is full of old memories. There is the house
of John Knox, the sturdy Reformer and typical
presbyterian. There is the Tolbooth—the Heart
of Midlothian. From the balcony of that old
mansion, called Moray House, a gay party were,
in 1650, with malicious and triumphant eyes,
looking down upon a crowd through which was
slowly wending a low cart, in which was
ignominiously bound down that spent thunderbolt
of war, Montrose—he is on his way to
execution. Aye, but in after years two in that
jubilant party—Argyles, father and son—will
both also pass up that street amidst jeering
crowds, and to similar fates.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Edinburgh Castle is the central feature of the
city. Its site is on the summit of a huge isolated
rock of eruptive basalt,—rising on the north
side,—out of the valley, now a garden, which
divides the new from the old town, to about
175 feet of perpendicular height. The castle,
with the slopes, occupies fully six acres of ground,
and includes barrack accommodation for 2,000
men; the armoury is calculated to contain 30,000
stands of arms. On the Argyle bastion there
is a huge piece of old artillery called Mons Meg;
it is constructed of wrought iron, and had burst
at the muzzle at its last discharge. Its liner
is formed of longitudinal bars,—these are strongly
hooped; it is thus allied in construction to that
of present ordnance, and, rude as the work is,
it shows the comparative high state of iron manufacture
amongst the Dutch several centuries ago.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>The castle was used by Malcolm Canmore and
his saintly queen, Margaret, as a royal residence.
The oldest building on the plateau which crowns
the rock, is St. Margaret’s Chapel, said to have
been used by the queen. On two sides of the
quadrangle called Palace Yard are an ancient
hall which has just been restored, and a suite
of residential apartments. In a small turret-chamber,
Mary’s son, James, was born. In a
well-protected room adjoining, the regalia of
Scotland—crown, sceptre, sword of state, and
other insignia—are shewn.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ancient regalia were “<em>conveyed</em>, the wise
it call,” out of Scotland by Edward I. Robert
Bruce was <em>crowned</em> at Scone with only a makeshift
crown; but it also fell into the hands of
the English. The present crown is, from the
style of its workmanship, supposed to have been
made in the later years of Bruce’s reign. It
was first used in the coronation of David II., in
1329. Later sovereigns added to the ornamentation.
The sword of state was presented to
James V. by Pope Julius II. There are also
certain jewels which were restored to Scotland
at the death of Cardinal York, the last of the
Stuarts.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>When Cromwell invaded Scotland, the regalia
were, for security, taken by the Earl Marischal
to his own strong castle of Dunottar, in Kincardineshire.
When this castle was besieged by
General Monk, the regalia—known to be there
by the English—were, by a feminine stratagem,
carried out by Mrs. Grainger, the wife of the
minister of the neighbouring church of Kinneff.
The minister buried them in the church, and
there they remained until the Restoration.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the Union, in 1707, the Scottish Estates
passed a resolution that the regalia were never
to be removed from Scotland. A hundred years
after the whereabouts was unknown,—their very
existence a matter of doubt. The following
extract is from the article “Edinburgh,” in
the “Edinburgh Encyclopedia,” edited by Sir
David Brewster, published about 1815:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“At the time of the Union, the Scottish regalia were, with
much solemnity, deposited in a strong iron-barred room,
entered from a narrow staircase; but most probably prudential
reasons have long ago led to their destruction or removal.
They were too dangerous insignias of royalty to lie within the
reach of the disaffected during the rebellions of the last
century. Towards its close, however, some doubts were
raised, and a warrant to search was issued to certain official
persons. Nothing was found but an old locked chest covered
with dust, and the deputation <em>did not think that they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>authorized to break this open</em>. So the search was abandoned,
and an opportunity, <em>not likely to recur</em>, of ascertaining whether
the regalia were really in existence, was lost.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>italics</i> are ours. In 1818, the regalia were
found in a search ordered by George IV.—then
Prince Regent—in that same old chest, which is
still in evidence at the back of the jewel room.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Holyrood Palace, founded by David I., in
1158, was originally an
abbey of St. Augustine
canons. The ruins of
the church evidence the
grandeur of the ancient
structure. Of a later
date is the north-west
wing of the palace,—a
portion of which was
a royal residence of
successive sovereigns.
One of the complaints
against James III. was
that he here preferred
the society of poets and
musicians, to that of the ruder nobility. James IV.
was also partial to artists and literary men. In
his <cite>Marmion</cite>, Sir Walter Scott has the quatrain:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“Still is thy name in high account</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Lord Lion King-at-arms!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Sir David was in the first half of the sixteenth
century the leading poet in Scotland. When a
boy he was page of honour to the infant king,
James V.,—carrying him on his back,—his
playmate, and, in a sense, his tutor. Sir
David addresses the king, giving some early
reminiscences:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And the first words that thou gan’st mute</div>
      <div class='line'>Were, ’pay Da Lin;” upon the lute</div>
      <div class='line'>Then played I twenty springs and three,—</div>
      <div class='line'>With whilk richt pleasurt thou would be.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The suite of apartments occupied by Queen
Mary are still left, with a portion of the old
furniture and hangings. As we wander through
the rooms, we can, in fancy, see Mary in the
audience chamber, in one of her distressing
interviews with the leaders of the Reformation,—when
most unjustifiable demands were made on
her that, against conscience and conviction, she
should renounce the faith in which she had been
nurtured,—should change her religion to accommodate
the popular change. Or, in the private
supper-room, see her and her ladies at their
needlework; or hear one of these ladies sing
an old Scots ballad of loves gone astray, and
with a sad ending. Then Rizzio’s rich baritone
rises in an Italian strain; and then there is on
these stairs the trampling of armed men, and foul
murder is done before the eyes of a queen and
an expectant mother; and her life is never the
same again.</p>

the church—the sepulchre of Scottish kings and
queens—has been allowed to become a ruin.</p>

  <h2 id='ch13' class='c004'>Offences and their Punishment in the Sixteenth Century.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>The century which included the Reformation,
and the long minorities of three
sovereigns,—James V., his daughter Mary, and
her son, James VI.,—all periods of strife and
unsettledness, was for Scotland, governmentally
and politically, a turbulent one. The state was
often in confusion; but the burghs were little
states, acting by their own laws, under properly
constituted magistrates.</p>

<p class='c006'>The oldest records of the Burgh Court of
Dundee which have been preserved commence
in 1550, and extend to 1568. These, with
other old records, have recently been carefully
examined, and many portions transcribed, by
Mr. Alexander Maxwell, <span class='fss'>F.S.A.</span> Scot., and they
form the ground-work for his two interesting
volumes on Old Dundee. With the author’s
kind permission, we make several extracts,
illustrative of the social history of the period, so
far as this is brought into view by the matters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>which came before the Burgh Court. These
records may be fairly taken as a sample of the
then condition, as respects crime, of the whole of
Scotland.</p>

<p class='c006'>And three things will be in evidence from
these records:—</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That this was really a Court of Justice;
patient consideration given, as a rule, to the cases
which came before it; and although some of the
punishments may seem severe, and others rather
ridiculous, yet on the whole the spirit was
paternal, corrective, and peace-making. The
penalties inflicted were all on the supposition that
the offenders had still a sense of shame left, and
that to have the good opinion of their fellows
was an incentive to well doing.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. That considering the unsettled condition of
the country, there was not an abnormal amount of
disorder and crime. Whisky, that curse of
Scotland in later years, had not come into use,
and there was no excessive ale and wine drinking.
Theft was not common.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. That a main point with the burgh authorities
was to get locally rid of their incorrigibles;
leaving neighbouring towns and the country
districts to take care of themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>That ever unruly member, the tongue, gave a
good deal of trouble:—</p>

<p class='c006'>Reche Crag, baker, being warned that his
bread was under weight, charged the officer with
using false weights to weigh his bread with, for
which insult “he is ordainit to come to the church
on Sunday next in the time of high mass to there
offer a candle of a pound of wax, to ask the
officer’s forgiveness, and say, That the word
was false he said.” James Denman, having
“blasphemed” a notary, has to ask his forgiveness,
and to pay to the master of the Hospital
twenty shillings to be given to the poor,—“and
gif he be again apprehendit with the like, to be
banishit the burgh a year and a day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>John Robertson and his wife had slandered
Katrine Butcher. John sung very small in
Court,—“revokit his allegance as nocht of veritie,
and he knows nocht of Katrine but honour.”
John’s wife appears to have first uttered the
slander in “flyting,” and she and he were
“adjudgit to come instantly to the Mercat Cross,
and there ask Katrine’s forgiveness upon their
knees: and gif the wife be funden by day or
nicht blasphemin any man or woman, she will be
banishit the burgh.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>For “wrangeous mispersoning of Will Gibson’s
wife, Jonet Crag is ordainit to pass to the Mercat
Cross, and on her knees, with the beads about her
neck to say ‘My tongue leeit,’ and pass with the
beads about the town.” The tolbooth “beads”
were derisively hung on the neck of a termagant,
whilst she made a promenade through the burgh.
Poor husbands had to bear the brunt of their
wives’ characters. William Rannald, being about
to leave the burgh, “the Council decernit that
nae testimonial be given to him; but if he labours
for ane, that it be made conform to his wife’s
demerits, and specify wherefore she was banishit
this burgh for ever.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Besse Spens is admonished “that gif she be
found flyting with ony neighbour, man or wife,
and specially agains Jonet Arthe, she shall be put
on the cuck-stule, and sit there twenty-four
hours.” This cuck-stule had just been put up in
an open position beside the Market Cross. To
be set up to public derision in this chair was the
height of ignominy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whilst in these comparatively rude times
women’s tongues often wagged fiercely against
each other, men’s wranglings would end in blows.
Charly Baxter “sall give to Robert Nicholson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>for the hurting of him, forty shillings, but as
Robert was also to blame, he sall pay the leech
[surgeon] himself. And gif ony of them maks
ony stroublance till other in time to come, to pay
a stane of wax to Our Lady.” So long as the old
Church held sway, fines were generally in candles
for lighting St. Mary’s altar.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stocks now and again come into the
record. For “stroublance of Patte Baxter, Jok
Galloway is ordainit to come on Sunday next
with a candle of a pund of wax, efter to be given
to Our Lady licht, and ask the Bailies and Patte’s
forgiveness. And gif he will nocht do this, to lie
the nicht in the stocks, and ask Patte’s forgiveness
the morn at the Mercat Cross.” Nichol Anderson
“is decernit to lie twenty-four hours in the stocks,
for stroubling of this gude town and wounding of
ane stranger, because he has nocht to pay the
leech.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When Rob Dawson “stroublit” Wille Pangell,
“he is ordainit to pay the leech for his craft of
healing Wille’s head breaking, and give Wille
twelve pence ilk day that the leech may depone
that he may nocht gudely lawbour through the
hurt.” “Henry Justice is ordained to cause cure
Margret Leischman’s head, broken by him within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>silence of the nicht.” It was an aggravation of
an offence that it was committed at night.
Allan Sowtar being charged by Besse Spens for
the “stroublance of her and her house, under
silence of the nicht, he is amerciate [punished by
fine] for the trouble done to this gude town, an if
he be founden committing sic fault again, nicht-walking
and making trouble, that he be banishit.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The sentences on a brawl in the churchyard, in
September, 1554, are notable as being the last in
the record where the fines were in the shape of
offerings on the high altar of St. Mary’s Church.
Fines where they were not given as a <i>solatium</i> to
the injured persons, were generally applied to aid
“puir folks.” And punishments were as a rule
inflicted summarily; lengthy imprisonments, taking
the persons away from their ordinary occupations
and maintaining them by the labours of others,
are quite a modern invention.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>The vehemence of an outrageous fisherman is
quenched in his own element. “George Blak,
boatman, is discernit to be doukit owr the head in
the sea, and also to pay forty shillings to the
common gude for that he keist Fothringham, ane
workman, our the shore [pier], and also struck
Andro Cowtie, ane other of them, upon the face.”
A worthless fellow is awarded the punishment of
a woman: “Sande Hay, for troublance made
upon Andro Watson, is discernit for his demerits
to be put in the cuck-stule, there to remain until
four hours efter noon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This is how an objectionable couple is got rid
of: “Alexr Clerke and Elesabeth Stevenson,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
being banishit this burgh for their demerits,
pykerie, and reset, and grite sumptuous spending
by nicht, has contemptuously come to the town,
contrair to the statutes; whairfore they are
adjudgit—Sande to be nailit to the tron by the
ear, and Elesabeth brunt upon the check, and
they be again banishit for all the days of their life.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>And gif ever they be fund within this burgh, or
ony of them, to be put to deith.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Nice distinctions were made in the comparative
guilt of accomplices: Watte Firsell and Duncan
Robertson are found guilty of “common pickery
of ane puir woman within silence of the nicht,”
and the sentence is,—“That Duncan sall scurge
Watte round about within the bounds of this
burgh, as use is; and gif he fails in the extreme
punishment of Watte, then Climas sall scurge
them baith, in his maist extreme manner. And
thereafter Watte to be had to the Cross, and, by
open proclamation, banishit this burgh for seven
years.” Climas was probably the burgh hangman,
for the Court assumed powers of life and death.
John Wilson has, for diverse reasons, been
“warded” within the burgh: “Gif he beis funden
passing out of this town, without licence of the
Provost or Bailies, to be put to deith without
forder proof.” In another case the manner of
threatened death is specified: “The assize hes
convict Agnes Robertson for theftuously committing
of pykrie—whilk she could nocht deny,
being apprehendit with her—and siclyke, hes
convict Jonett Moreis for reset thereof. And
thairfore the Bailies ordain Agnes to be banishit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>this burgh for all the days of her life, and never
to be apprehendit within the same, under the pain
of drowning. And siclyke Jonett to be banishit
for year and day, and gif she be apprehendit
within the burgh before the said day, to suffer
deith as said is.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Generally in cases of theft, and where there
were no aggravating circumstances, justice was
satisfied by simple restitution or compensation.</p>

<p class='c006'>John Cathro is relieved from the charge of
carrying away the iron band of Will Cathro’s door
by his offer to make a new band “as gude as it
was at first.” John shortly after comes up again
“for the wrangous taking of five lilies out of
John Gagy’s harth, and is ordainit to put in five
fresh lillies again.” A gleaner who has been
helping herself to corn from a farmer’s stooks,
only has the blanket seized in which she carried
it. When there were aggravating circumstances
theft was punished by flogging.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Vehement suspicion,” without direct proof,
was sometimes held to justify punishment.
“James Richardson, tailzour, being accusit of
pickrie, is adjudgit to be punishit with twelve
straiks with ane double belt, because there could
be nae sufficient proof gotten, but vehement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>suspicion, and syne to be banishit this burgh for
year and day.” Another tailor is, however, able
to prove his honesty. Sande Loke is accused by
Jonet Sands, of keeping back some of the cloth
that should have gone into her kirtle. The
kirtle was produced, and Sande ripped open the
seams, and laid it upon “ten quarters of new
claith of like breid, and it was found to be nocht
minished by the craftsman.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The habit of wearing swords, or “whingers,” as
they are called, was a fertile cause of quarrelling
and personal injury. Sometimes offenders were
degraded by being for a time prohibited from
wearing swords: thus, William Fyf and James
Richardson are, after an encounter, “convict for
troublance of this burgh by invading ilk other
with wapins; William is discernit to pay the
barbour whilk heals James’ arm, stricken by him
with ane whinger; and baith are forbidden to
wear whingers for the space of ane year, or to
invade other by word or deed in time coming,
under the pain of banishing the party whilk sall
be found culpable.”</p>

<p class='c006'>John Anderson “is decernit to pay to the
common gude, the soum of five pounds for his
unlaw in breaking of the acts, by drawing of ane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>whinger and invading of Archibald Kyd for his
bodily harm, publicly in open mercat; and he sall
pass to the place where he offendit Archibald,
and, upon his knees, desire of him forgiveness.
And his whinger is to be taken from him, and put
in the cuck-stule.” Jonkyn Davidson “hurt and
woundit John Jack in his body, with ane whinger,
to the effusion of his blude in grite quantitie.”
The Bailies for amends “decernit that, upon
Saturday next Jonkyn sall come to the Mercat
Cross in his sark alane, his head discoverit, and,
upon his knees, take his whinger by the point and
deliver the same to John; and thereafter the officer
sall affix it in the place whair the whingers of those
are affixit that commit tulzie within the burgh.
And Jonkyn sall ask mercy and forgiveness at
John, for God’s sake, for his crime; and then sall
act himself to be true friend to John, and sall
never hear nor see his hurt nor skaith, but will
tak part with him in all lawful things; and sal
never draw a whinger hereafter, on ony inhabitant,
under the pain of banishing this burgh for ever.”
Furthermore he becomes bound to pay John by
instalments the sum of one hundred pounds. On
the day named, Jonkyn, at the Market Cross,
made the prescribed atonement, “and then John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>receivit him in favour, embracit him in his arms,
and forgave him the crime.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Penalties for Immorality.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>It was not only overt crimes which came under
the jurisdiction of the magistrates; they also took
cognizance of conduct and habits which were
considered indecent, or which might lead to
breaches of the public peace. Thus the ringing
of the ten o’clock bell was the call to a general
clearance of the streets and alehouses, a notification
that the burgh was entering into “the silence of
nicht.” It was enacted that “Nae person be
fund walking in the nicht season, prevatlie or
openlie in the streets or gaits of the burgh, or
drinking in ony ale or wine tavern efter ten hours
of the nicht, under the pain of forty shillings<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> for
the first fault, and for the next fault to be
banishit; and that nane sell ale or wine to sic
persons, under the pain of banishing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was also enacted, “Forsameikle as we know
it to be the command of God that there sall
nocht be ony drunkards among his people, we
therefore ordain that gif ony man be apprehended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>in drunkenness, he sall pay for the first fault five
merks unforgiven, for the second ten merks, and
for the third ten pounds, to be taken up by the
deacons and distribute to the puir. And gif he
will nocht mend, but continue, then the Bailies
sall give him ane sys [assize] of neighbours, and
gif he beis convictit, he sall be banishit for year
and day, and sall nocht be receivit without his
open repentance.” Provision is made for inability
to pay fines; this is commuted for so many days
in “thiefs hol,” and the same act to proceed upon
drunken women.</p>

<p class='c006'>And again, “That gif ony men or women be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>notit as common blasphemers of the holy name of
God, the Bailies sall give them ane sys of neighbours;
and gif they be convicted of it, they sall
be usit samen as drunkards, quhidder they be
rich or puir.” But a more summary system than
that of assize was also adopted. “Quhasover is
apprehendit banning, execrating, swearing, or
blaspheming openly, sall be taen incontinent and
put an hour in the choks.” This instrument of
punishment was furnished with a gag which
entered the mouth; and besides the one for
public offenders, the citizens were “ordainit” to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>keep in readiness their own “choks for correcting
of the banners and swearers in their awn
domestic houses.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It is ordered that keepers of houses of ill-fame,
“sall dispatch themselves off the town, or else
amend, and leave sic vicious manner of leiving;
for gif they be apprehendit therewith in time
coming, they sall be openly banishit at the
Mercat Croce.” Unchaste conduct met with
severe reprobation. Men and women were “for
the first fault to be admonishit by the preachers
to forbear, and to shaw their open repentance
publicly in presence of the haill congregation, and
so forbear in time coming. But gif he and she be
again apprehendit in the same fault, they sall
stand three hours in the gyves, and be thrice
doukit in the sea, and gif that punishment serves
nocht for amendment, they sall be banishit for
ever.” But the life of a coming child was not to
be endangered in punishing an unchaste woman;
it was enacted that, under such circumstances,
“the woman, of what estate so ever she be, sall
be brocht to the Mercat Croce openly, and there
her hair sall be cuttit of, and the same nailit upon
the cuck-stool, and she make her public repentance
in the Kirk.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Exposing offenders to popular derision was a
common mode of punishment in Scotland. The
stocks and the cuck-stool in the market-place, and
the stool-of-repentance in the church, were all
used on the supposition that the evildoer had still
shame and a wholesome dread of the finger of
scorn lingering in the heart. The <i>jougs</i>—a
hinged iron band for the neck, attached by a
chain to the market cross, the gate-post of the
parish church, or the tolbooth, a tree, or other wise—were
a common institution. The offence of the
culprit would be placarded in bold characters and
very plain terms on his or her breast, or overhead.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Administration of the Effects of Persons Dying. Dress Regulations.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Still drawing upon Mr. Alex. Maxwell’s
researches amongst the municipal records of
Dundee in the middle years of the sixteenth
century, we learn that the Town Council, finding
that much confusion arose from the improvidence
of many of the citizens in not making testamentary
dispositions of their effects, it was ordained:
“that there sall be twa honest men—responsal,
famous and godlie—chosen by the general
consent of the haill estates of the town, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>power given to them to pass—quhidder they be
requyrit or nocht—to visit man or woman in
peril of death; and they sall enquire at the sick
gif they will mak ane testament, and gif they
consent, then the visitors sall despatch and put
out of the house all manner of man, and woman,
and bairn, except such honest and sober persons
as the sick sall desire to be present as witnesses;
and the devyse and legacy then made by the sick
person to be registrat authentically in the buiks
of the visitors, who after the decease of the
person testit as said is, sall see the dead’s will
fulfillit.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The dress worn by burgesses and others was
required by law to be suited to the degree of the
wearer. In the fifteenth century, Parliament
ordained “anent the commons, that nae lauborars
nor husbandmen wear on the week day any
clothes but gray and quhite, and on haliday licht
blue, and green or red; and their wifis corresponding,
with curches of their awn making, the
stuff nocht to exceed the price of forty pennies the
ell. And that nae men within burgh that live by
merchandise, unless they be in dignity as Bailie,
or gude worthy man of the Council, shall wear
claiths of silks, nor costly scarlett gowns, nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>furrings; and that they make their wifis and
dochters in like manner to dress becomingly, and
corresponding to their estate; on their heids short
curches, with little hudis, as are usit in England;
and as to their gowns, that nae woman wear costly
furs, nor have tails of unsuiting length, but on the
haliday: and that no woman come to the kirk or
market with her face coverit, that she may not be
kend.” By another act, in 1567, it was ordered
“that nae women wear dress abone their estait,
except——.” The word we omit is spelled in
the original the same as that which designates
the nymphs in the Mahometan paradise.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>The following extracts from the Burgh
records are interesting, as illustrating
the history and the manners of the 15th and 16th
centuries.</p>

<p class='c006'>21st April, 1452.—“The maist parte of the
hale communitie of the burgh, consentit that
because of perile, the toune sal be stregnthinit
with walles, and fortifitt in a gudely manner.”</p>

<p class='c006'>1st February, 1484.—“It is ordainit that the
talyeours, and al other craftsmen, sal beyr their
taykins of their craft upon their brestis, and their
best array on Candilmas Day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>4th July, 1497.—Henry VII. was at this time
retaliating on Scotland for the invasion of
Northumberland by James IV., and for his
assisting the imposter, Perkin Warbeck, in his
claims upon the English throne:—“It is ordanit
that a watch be set nichtly, for the sayfty of the
town against the Inglish, and gif they propose to
lande on the northt partis of the havyne, that all
mannere of men, with their carts of weir, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>horses, gunrye, artailzerie, and all other defensebile
wapinnis, be redy, and pass to resist thame, for
the saiftie of our Cathedral Kirk, my lord of
Aberdenis Palace, our maisteris the chanonis, and
ther familiaris and habitaciones.”</p>

<p class='c006'>30th January, 1510.—“It is ordanit that on
Candlemas Day, as is the yerlie ryt and custom
of the burgh, in the honor of God and the Blissit
Virgin Mary, there shall be the processioun of
craftsmen, tua and tua togidr, socialie, als

Lady Sanct Brid, and Sanct Elene; and the
skynners the Tua Bischopis; and tua of ilke craft
to pass with the pageant that thai furnyss to keip
their gear.”</p>

<p class='c006'>4th May, 1511.—Respecting the reception of
Margaret, the Queen of James IV., it is ordered
that this be “als honorablie as in ony burgh of
Scotland, except Edinburgh allanarlie.” The
poet Dunbar appears to have been present at the
reception, and has left a graphic description of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>pageant. In the welcoming procession, giving
“honorabill salutation,” came first the “sweitt
Virgin,” then the three orient Kings, with their
offerings to Christ; and then the “Angill” with
flaming sword, driving, for their disobedience,
Adam and Eve out of Paradise:—</p>

<p class='c006'>26th February, 1512.—“Philip Clerk, bellman,”
was brought up for passing with his bell through
the town, and, on his own notion, announcing that
oysters just landed would be sold ten for fourpence,
when the boatmen’s price was ten for sixpence.
“It was ordainit the said belman suld syt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>dune on his knees, and ask the ownaris of the
said oysteris forgiwness: and his crag [neck] be
put in the goyf at their wyte.”</p>

<p class='c006'>12th May, 1514.—This was a few months after
Flodden, when there was still “a moanin in ilka
green loanin,” for the flowers of the land “a’
wede away” upon that fatal field. “Ordanit be
the prouest, consail, and communitee of this

Ingland, thar be warnyt nychtly aucht able men,

<p class='c006'>14th August, 1525.—A copy is put in the
records of an Act of Parliament just then passed:—“that
forasmekle as the dampnable opinzeons

schippis and gudis, and putting of thair personnys
in presone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>6th January, 1561.—The Reformation had
now made such progress that the churches were
being stripped of their old vessels and ornaments.
“The said day the town beand lauchtfully warnit
to heir and se the silver wark, brasin wark,
keippis and ornaments of thair parroche Kirk
ropit [<i>i.e.</i>, sold by auction], and the same to be

And the articles so sold were delivered to
the said Patrik; but not without protest, for, “the

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>9th October, 1601.—“The prouest, bailleis,

It has been suggested that Shakespeare was one
in this company of London players.</p>

<p class='c006'>10th March, 1606.—Although Presbyterianism
was now the general religious faith in Scotland,
certain customs connected with the Old Church
appear to have still lingered on. “Intimationne
was this day made by the belman throw the haill
toune, at command of the prouest and baillies
thereof, that no inhabitant eat onie flesche during

the panes contenit in his Majestie’s actis and
proclamationnes maid thiaranent.”</p>

<p class='c006'>26th December, 1606.—Forbes Mackenzie had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>his forerunners in these days, and their edicts
were of even more stringent application.
“Ordaneit, with consent of the haill toune this
day convenit, that it sall not be lesum to onie
hostilar, tavernar, or vinter of wyne, aill, or
beir, to sell or vent onie wyne, aill, or beir,
fra ten houris at nicht furth, at the quhilk hour
nichtlie the colledge bell sall ring; efter the
ringing quhairof, no persone, man or woman,
except sic as have necessarie errandis to be fand
gangard vpon the streitis or caisayes of the
burght; under penaltie efter conviction in ane
vnlaw of fyve pundis.”</p>

<p class='c006'>28th November, 1606.—The compulsory enforcement
of what were held to be religious obligations
was not the outcome of particular forms of faith,
or of special times. The Aberdeen magistrates
ordain:—“That the haill inhabitants shall repair
to the preaching in St. Machars Kirk, on Sunday
and Wednesday, under the pains following—viz.,
the goodman and goodwife of the house contravening,
6s. 8d.; and ilk servant, 2s., Scots.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In the records of the Kirk-Session of Aberdeen,
we read:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is thocht expedient that ane baillie with
two of the sessioun pass thro the toun every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Sabbath-day, and nott sic as they find absent
from the sermones; that for that effect they
serche sic houses as they think maist meit; and
chiefly that now, during the symmer seasoun, they
attend, or caus ane to attend, at the ferrie boat,
and nott the names of such as gang to Downie;
that they may be punishit, conform to the Act,
against brackaris of the Sabbath.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The tendency of the following order would be
towards good digestion:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is ordanit that na disputation nir reasonying
of the Scriptures be at dennar or supper or oppin

  <h2 id='ch15' class='c004'>Witchcraft in Scotland.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Common-sense and everyday experience
are at constant war with superstition.
But superstition dies hard; like a noxious weed
which has spread in a fair garden, if plucked up
in one place it will appear unexpectedly in
another. The Reformers rejected the alleged
daily miracle of the Romish mass; in spite of the
prayers, the genuflections, and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Hoc est Corpus</i></span>
of the priest, the bread and wine still remained
bread and wine. They rejected other alleged
miracles of the Catholic Church—the healings
and other benefits from relics, and pilgrimages,
and holy wells. But an influx of belief in
witchcraft set in on the ebb-tide of the old faith.
Men and women—especially women—were
supposed to have entered into league with the
spirit of evil; by selling their souls to him, they
had conferred upon them in return certain
supernatural powers,—generally to the injury of
their fellows.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the latter portion of the sixteenth, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>throughout the seventeenth century, a belief in
witchcraft was very general in Scotland; and
prosecutions for the alleged crime very frequent.
That royal pedant, James VI., wrote a treatise
against witchcraft. He had himself been the
object of witchly machinations. Witches conspired
with Satan to raise a tempest and wreck
the ship in which, in 1590, he was bringing home
his bride, Anne of Denmark. In May, 1591,
a Convention sat in Edinburgh, “anent order
to be tane with sorcerers and certain practisers
against his Majesty’s person.” An assize was
then sitting upon witches, in the business of
which the King took an active part. Under
torture the wretched creatures made extraordinary
confessions,—one was of a meeting which they
had with the Devil in North Berwick Church, when,
after casting sundry spells upon the King and
Queen, they concluded their revels with a dance,
the music for which was played by one of the
women on a jew’s-harp,—and this she repeated at
the trial, upon his Majesty’s request, for his
particular delectation!</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the punishment on conviction,—about
this there could be no dispute. Had not Moses,
more than two thousand years previously, written
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>in his law:—“Thou shalt not suffer a witch to
live?” No use saying that this law had only
reference to circumstances in old Hebrew history,
or that the newer teaching was the more
enlightened, the more humane, the more generally
applicable gospel of Christ. What were now
called witches had to die.</p>

<p class='c006'>Most of those who were thus put to death
as witches were poor old women,—often soured
and peevish in temper, ready to resent any slight,
and to croak out evil wishes and forebodings.
And when evils did occur, when sickness came
into a house, or blight into its orchard, or the cows’
yield of milk was scanty, or the butter would not
form in the churn, then the cause was assigned to
the spells and cantrips of the “ill-wisher.” Often,
to raise their own importance, and make themselves
feared, these women would pretend to the
possession of occult powers,—to the knowledge
of potions and charms,—both for the infliction
and the recovery of disease; as also of philters to
induce love. And they would themselves come
to believe in their possession of such powers.
And hence on trial, under torture, or after
sentence, they would make confession of witchcraft,
with strange disordered narratives of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Satanic leagues and unholy revellings. A
woman was called a white witch whose specialty
was the cure of disease, or the recovery of lost
or stolen property; but none the less was she
liable—like Rebecca in “Ivanhoe”—to be tried
as a sorceress, and suffer the penalty thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not alone the old or the poor who were
accused of witchcraft. At times young women,
and even young men,—and persons in a good
social position were so accused. And as an
outcome of the crusade against witchcraft, there
arose a tribe of “witch-finders.” Pretenders to a
knowledge of indicative marks and moles and
other signs, were permitted to torture the
suspects—to extort confession—being then paid
their professional fees.</p>

<p class='c006'>A witch was supposed to have as an accomplice,
a familiar spirit,—often in the shape of a black
cat,—an incarnation of the Evil one, or of one
of his imps. Sometimes the master-fiend held
provincial Walpurgis nights, when he assembled
all his subjects in a neighbourhood to a high-jinks
festival—a scene of wild riot, of blasphemy, and of
conspiracy to do evil.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is to one of these orgies in Auld Alloway
Kirk that Burns introduces his bemuddled hero,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Tam o’ Shanter. But this poetical phantasy
hardly surpasses in absurdity the plain prose of
the following indictment against Thomas Leyis,
of Aberdeen:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Imprimis, upon Hallowein last by past (1596)
at twelff houris of even or thairby, thou the said
Thomas Leyis, accompaneit with Janett Wischert,
Isobel Coker, Isobell Monteithe, and Kathren
Mitchell, sorceroris and witches, with ane gryt
number of ither witches, cam to the mercat and
fish cross of Aberdene, under the conduct and
gyding of the dewill—present with you all in
company, playing before you on his kynd of
instruments. Ye all dansit about baythe the said
crosse and the meill mercate ane lang space of
tym; in the quhilk dewill’s dans, thou, the said
Thomas, was foremost and led the ring, and dang
[struck] the said Kathren Mitchell, because she
spoilt your dans, and ran nocht so fast about as
the rest. Testifeit be the said Kathren Mitchell,
wha was present at the time aforesaid, dansin
with the dewill.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The items of expenses in the burning of
Thomas Leyis, Janet Wischert, and Isobel Coker,
viz.: for peats, tar barrels, coals, and tow,—and
to Jon Justice for their execution, as they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>to-day found in the Town’s Accounts, are a
fearful indictment against the enlightenment and
humanity of three hundred years ago. But
perhaps the last item in the costs of that veritable
devil’s festival is the most gruesome and
repulsive:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“For trailing Isobell Monteithe through the
streets of the town in ane cart, quha hangit
herself in prison, and burying of her, 10s.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In that year, 1597, twenty-three women and
one man were burned in the university city of
Aberdeen for witchcraft.</p>

  <h2 id='ch16' class='c004'>Holy Wells in Scotland.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>A spring of water issuing from the hillside,
or from clefts in the rocks—leaping and
sparkling, as if in joyance at having from the
dark womb of the earth come into the light and
freedom of open day—has often been the parent of
mystery, of myth, and tradition. The knowledge,
common in older times, did not enable the people
to see that the spring was merely the outflow by
natural gravitation of the rainfall on the more or
less distant uplands. The licking up of portions
of all the strata through which the water had
percolated, and which portions, unseen by the
eye, but present in the taste, it now held in
solution, was thought to be a natural quality of
the particular water. And as ordinary medicines
are always associated with unpleasantness of taste,
so in waters impregnated with mineral ingredients,
the harsher the taste, the greater medicinal
properties were attached to them. And the
higher temperature of many mineral springs was
also considered to be an innate property of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>mystical, almost miraculous, particular waters.
We now know that this is caused by the waters,
in following rifts and fissures in the strata, in
their passage to their outlet, having had to
descend to lower depths, and being thus warmed
by the internal heat of the globe: acquiring
one additional degree of temperature for about
every seventy feet of descent.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the old Greeks had in their pantheon of the
powers of Nature, Naiads—nymphs of the
fountain—so in our older folk-lore the streams
had their Kelpies or other guardian spirits.
When the Christian Church became paramount,
the Catholic Canon of saints and angels took the
places of the Teutonic and Scandinavian sprites:
each spring was dedicated to, or became the
property of, a particular saint; and it was he or
she who gave the waters their special qualities.</p>

<p class='c006'>At some of these holy springs or wells it was
customary for ailing persons to go, for the cure of
their diseases, on the first Sunday in May; they
washed in the streams, and left presents to the
tutelar saints; pieces of money were put in the
waters, or poor people would place needles and
pins, or other small articles, therein. On a hill
near Stirling was the well of St. Corbet, to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>pilgrimages were thus made. To drink its waters
was a safe and easy insurance of life throughout
the twelve months ensuing. Up to a hundred
years ago crowds of persons—including a large
proportion of lads and lasses—came to the blessed
well, drinking copious draughts of its waters, but
too often mixing these with the strong waters of
Kilbagie, of Glenlivat, or other such brand. The
wise saint evidently did not approve of this
adulteration, for with the practice his well lost its
life-preserving reputation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The waters of the well of St. Fillan, in
Strathfillan were supposed to be curative of
insanity. The patient was roughly thrown into
the pool; he was then taken to the adjoining
chapel, and left bound therein during the night;
if likely to recover he would be found loose in the
morning. Mothers brought their weak and ailing
children, bathed them in the well, and as a
propitiatory fee to the saint, hung a bit of ribbon,
or a scrap of coloured cloth, on the witch-elm
which shaded his spring.</p>

<p class='c006'>At Musselburgh was a well celebrated for its
healing virtues, and its powers of insuring good
luck. Expectant mothers sent their child-bed
linen to be sprinkled by the water, and consecrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>by the priest of the adjoining chapel,
which was dedicated to our Lady of Loretto.
Four hundred years ago it was esteemed the most
miraculously gifted shrine in Scotland. King
James V. is said to have made a pilgrimage to it
from Stirling before he went to France to woo his
future queen. If the pilgrimage helped to bring
Mary of Guise to Scotland—Scotland had little
cause for gratitude therefore!</p>

<p class='c006'>A well at Muthill, near Crieff, was thought to be
a cure for whooping-cough; the waters had to be
drank before sunrise, or after sunset, through a
cow’s horn. Another well near by had a reputation
as curative of madness. A third well was
dedicated to St. Patrick; how it came to be so is
not easily understood; for the British Priest who
became the apostle and tutelary saint of Ireland,
had no connection with the district; and yet his
day in the calendar was formerly observed there
as a holiday.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Strathnaven is a small loch of supposed
healing waters. There was a rigid rule as to the
mode of bathing. Persons must walk backwards
into the loch; when at sufficient depth they are to
immerse themselves—leave a coin—then, without
looking round, walk ashore, and so away.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>The well of Spa, near Aberdeen, had a high
reputation for its medicinal virtues. Its waters
were conveyed from the spring by a long white
stone, with the images of six apostles carved upon
either side thereof. In 1615, Dr. Wm.
Barclay, an eminent physician, published a
book on the virtues of this well: giving some
extraordinary instances of cures from what
seemed mortal ailments, by drinking its
waters.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Reformation brought loss of prestige to
the old Romish Saints, and the Scottish Kirk is
found testifying against pilgrimages to reputed
holy wells. The following is an extract from the
Presbytery Book of Strathbogie:—“September
14, 1636. Peter Wat summond to this day for
going in pilgrimage to the chapell beyond the
water of Spey, compeared and confessed his fault.
Ordained to make his repentance, and to paye
four markes penaltye. Agnes Jack summoned to
this daye for going in pilgrimage to the same
chapell, compeared, and confessed that she
went to the same chapell with ane deseased
woman, but gave her great oath that
she used no kynd of superstituous worship.
She is ordained to make her publike repentance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>and to abstaine from the lyke in time
coming.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Margrat Davidson was adjudget to an unlaw
of fyve pounds, for directing her nurs with her
bairne to St. Fithak’s well, and washin the bairne
thairin for the recovery of her health, and for
leaving an offering in the well.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch17' class='c004'>Scottish Marriage Customs.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'>January and May were considered unlucky
months to marry in. In some localities
there was a proverb—“A bride in May, is
thriftless aye.” The day of the week on which
the 14th of May fell, was held to be an unlucky
wedding day throughout the remainder of the
year. Highland marriages took place as a rule in
the churches; in the Lowlands the ceremony was
generally performed at the residence of the bride’s
father; but often in later years at the minister’s
manse. When two marriages were to take place
at a church upon the same day, arrangements had
to be made that one party should not meet the
other going to or returning from church. During
a marriage ceremony, great care had to be taken
that no dogs passed between bride and bridegroom;
and the bridegroom’s left shoe had been
untied or unbuckled by his best man, to prevent
witches casting uncanny spells over the young
couple.</p>

<p class='c006'>The wedding feast was held in the evening,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>generally at the house of the bride’s father.
After supper, dancing began, the bridal pair being
in the first reel; from their supposed bashfulness,
it was called the <i>shemit</i>,—that is, shame-faced reel.
Dancing and mirth were kept up until the small
hours; but before then the young couple—usually
escorted by some of the young folks—had slipped
away to their own domicile; the best man and
bridesmaid having preceded them, the latter with
a cake of short-bread, ready to break over the
bride’s head on her entering the doorway. The
bride was not expected to be seen out about until
the couple were “kirkit” on the following
Sunday. A newly-made mother’s first public
appearance was also in church going.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Penny-weddings,” were large gatherings of
self-invited guests, each of whom was expected to
contribute towards the cost of the festivities; any
balance which might be over, to go to help in the
new house-keeping.</p>

<p class='c006'>Prior to the Reformation, a loose practice in
the relationship of the sexes, called <i>hand-fasting</i>,
existed in Scotland. At the statutory fairs,
young men and women made mutual selection as
partners for a year; at the end of the year, they
were free to marry, to live singly, or to enter into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>other partnerships! It was the duty of the
itinerant friars to persuade the handfasts to marry,
and by the end of the sixteenth century the
Reformers had effectually rooted out the custom.
At the Dundee Burgh Court on May 21st 1560,
“Compearit John Ray, and oblist him to marry
his wife on Sunday next. At the same time
James Rollock has become surety that Robert
Man sall complete the band of matrimony with
Jonet Myln, or else incur the danger conteinit in
the acts.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ceasing to be considered a sacrament, marriage
in Scotland came to be looked upon as little other
than a civil contract, hardly requiring clerical
agency, or religious formalities. A man and
woman going before a bailie or sheriff, and
declaring themselves husband and wife, constituted
a legal although an irregular marriage.
And the celebrant—if so he could be called, who
was really only a witness to the parties having
<em>married themselves</em>—need not even be a civil
official. Gretna Green had no special privilege
in lay-marrying over any other portion of
Scotland.</p>

<p class='c006'>It appears from Burgh records that in the
sixteenth century, a women holding property
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>under a trusteeship, was not at any age free in
her choice of a husband. Marrying without the
consent of her procurators entailed the forfeiture
of her property. A mother would retain her
daughter’s tocher unless she married with the
mother’s approval.</p>

<p class='c006'>And apprentices were not allowed to marry
without the official permission of their craft. We
find from the Dundee Burgh records, that in
1534, David Ogilvy, an apprentice baker, did so
marry, and he was expelled from his craft, and
“tynt his freedom.” But David took the decree
fighting! He appealed to the King, James the
Fifth, for reinstatement, and the King gave an
order, confirmed by the Lords of Council,
charging the Provost and Bailies of Dundee to
re-admit him to his freedom, and “cause the
baxters receive him to their fellowship, notwithstanding
that he be marryit within his prenticeship,”
and decerning that he will suffer sufficient
punishment if his term of apprenticeship be
prolonged for the space of one month.</p>

<p class='c006'>A bride was expected—even in such circumstances
of life as made her a “tocherless lass”—to
have ready against her marriage many articles
of domestic economy. In his song “Woo’d and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Married and a’,”—written a century and a
half ago—Alexander Ross gives a graphic
description of a family conference over the
ways and means of an “ill-provided”
bride:—</p>

  <h2 id='ch18' class='c004'>Scotland under Charles the First.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>James died in March, 1625, and a few days
thereafter his son Charles was proclaimed
at the Edinburgh Cross, King of Scotland; but
it was eight years later before he visited the land
of his fathers, and was crowned as its King in
Holyrood. The then finest poet in Scotland was
William Drummond of Hawthornden, and to him
was confided the address of welcome to Charles.
The address was not in verse, but only in prose—run
mad! “If nature,” it began, “could suffer
rocks to move and abandon their natural places,
this town—founded on the strength of rocks—had,
with her castle, temples, and houses, moved
towards you, and besought you to acknowledge
her yours; her indwellers, your most humble and
affectionate subjects; and to believe how many
souls are within her circuits, so many lives are
devoted to your sacred person and crown;” and
so on. When the subjects’ flattery was so
obsequious, we can hardly wonder at the amount
of royal arrogance and assumption.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>The people were a good deal disturbed about
the ceremonial of Charles’s coronation; an altar
was introduced, and some of the rites seemed to
savour of popery. He had Laud and some other
English bishops in his retinue, and the King soon
gave evidence of his intention to carry out the
later attempts of his father, to introduce prelacy,
with its subordination to the crown, into Scotland.
Now the old bishoprics of the Catholic Church
had never been formally abolished, but the titles
had been held by laymen of mean rank,—whilst
the bulk of the emoluments had gone to certain of
the nobles. The nominal bishops were nicknamed
<i>Tulchans</i>; a tulchan being a calf-skin
stuffed with straw, which was set up alongside of
the mother-cow, to induce her to yield her milk
more freely. The bishop had the title, but my
lord had the milk. There was thus a framework
of episcopacy in Scotland, and James had in the
last year of his reign, ordered its re-establishment
in full authority; archbishops and bishops to have
under himself the headship of the Scottish
Church.</p>

<p class='c006'>Charles now confirmed the division of Scotland
into dioceses, that of Edinburgh to include all the
country south of the Forth; St. Giles to be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Cathedral church,—a wall which had been built
to partition off the church into two separate places
of worship, to be removed. Four years later, in
1637, the Kings projects had so far advanced,
that a liturgy, moulded on that of the English
church—but where it differed, with a stronger
flavour of Rome—was ordered to be used in St.
Giles’s. On the first Sunday of the innovation,
the church was crowded; two archbishops,
several bishops, lords of the privy council, the
judges and city magistrates, being in the congregation.
When the dean, in his surplice, began
the service, an old woman—Jenny Geddes,—started
up and exclaimed,—“You false loon, will
you rout your black mass in my lugg?” and
threw her stool at the dean’s head. This was a
signal for a general uproar, in the midst of which
the dean had his surplice torn off by excited
women. Stones and other missiles were thrown
at the bishops: the magistrates called in the
Town Guard to drive the malcontents out of the
church; but these by breaking the windows,
battering at the doors, and wild clamour, drowned
the dean’s voice, as he again ventured on his
ungracious task. In the Greyfriars’ church the
new liturgy was stopped by popular clamour.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>With the obstinancy of his race, Charles
persisted in his designs. He issued proclamations
denouncing as rebellion all obstruction to his
remodelled church, and transferred the seat of
government and the courts of law to Linlithgow.
These proclamations were replied to by strong
protests from nearly every Corporation in the
Kingdom, and the <i>Solemn League and Covenant</i>,
which had in the previous reign been instituted
against popery, was enthusiastically renewed, and
subscribed by men and women in all grades of
society.</p>

<p class='c006'>Charles sent down the Marquis of Hamilton as
his High Commissioner, empowered to treat with
the Covenanters. Hamilton took with him to
Edinburgh a retinue of nobility and gentry, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>were supposed to be friendly to the royal cause.
He was met by a great concourse of people,
amongst whom were six thousand ministers in their
black Geneva gowns. He opened his commission,
but the presbyterian leaders would hear of no terms
being made, as they said, with Antichrist. So
Hamilton went back to London, and reported his
non-success to his master. Again he came to
Edinburgh, this time with some concessions, the
king offering to subscribe to the original form of
the Covenant, which contained no mention of
prelacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Under the Kings sanction, a General Assembly
met in Glasgow, in November 1638. The royal
commissioner protested against certain proceedings,
and he formally dissolved and retired from
the Assembly: but under its moderator it
continued its sittings, condemning the king’s
liturgy and the imposition of an episcopacy. The
reply of Charles was the pouring of two armies
into Scotland, one being under his own command.
The Covenanters, with whose cause Parliament
had identified itself, were not slack in taking up
the challenge. They appointed General Leslie,
a veteran from the wars of Gustavus Adolphus,
to the command of a hastily raised army. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>seized on all the fortified places; and he fortified
Leith, to defend Edinburgh from the king’s fleet.
In view of these warlike preparations, Charles
temporized, and a vague kind of treaty was
negotiated. Another General Assembly met
next year in Edinburgh; and here the Royal Commissioner
gave formal sanction to the decisions
of the Glasgow Assembly. This sanction was
received with an outburst of enthusiastic gratitude;
and loyalty—never far from a Scotchman’s heart—was
again in the ascendant. But it was a
delusion and a snare. The king repudiated the
concessions of his own commissioner, prorogued
the Parliament which met to sanction the
proceedings of the assembly, and prepared for a
fresh invasion of Scotland. The Scots anticipated
his purpose by sending their army into England—where
many were friendly to their cause.
There was a battle at Newburn, on the Tyne, in
which the royal troops were defeated. The Scots
occupied Newcastle—and negotiations were again
opened for peace.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Charles had by this time embroiled
himself with his English subjects. He had tried
to raise money by other means than through
Parliament. A Parliament sitting in 1628, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>refused him supplies for carrying on a war with
Spain; it had also challenged his assumed right
to imprison his subjects on his own warrant; and
they presented to him what was called a <i>Petition
of Right</i>, claiming exemption from arbitrary
taxation and imprisonment. Charles found it
expedient for the moment to sanction this Bill;
but soon thereafter he dissolved Parliament, and
obstinately refused to call another. For eleven
years, under the influence and with the aid of
Archbishop Laud, and Wentworth, Earl of
Stratford, he played at the dangerous game of
<i>Thorough</i>. He governed as an irresponsible
autocrat, arbitrarily levying taxes, and imprisoning
obnoxious opponents, in defiance of the
Petition of Right. The <i>Puritans</i>, or church
reformers, suffered severely. Many were dragged
before a court, unknown to the constitution or
common law, called the Star Chamber, which
professed to take cognisance of offences against
religion and the royal prerogative. Men of piety,
of learning and worth, were imprisoned, were
scourged through the streets, had their noses slit,
or their ears cropped, for expressing differences
of opinion on even minor matters in the policy of
the church or the state.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Who were the Puritans? For answer we must
go back to the English reign of James. There
had been considerable intercourse between the
Reformers of the two kingdoms, and the more
democratic and anti-Romish constitution of the
Scottish Church, had had many sympathisers in
England. From these a party was formed, which
came to be called Puritans; they were not
dissenters,—none such being then recognised in
the country; but were chiefly English clergymen.
A petition, signed by nearly a thousand clergymen,
was presented to the King, praying for a revision
of the Book of Common Prayer,—the disuse of
the surplice in reading, of the sign of the cross in
baptism, and of bowing at the name of Jesus;
also for a reform in the distribution of patronage,
and the abolition of pluralities. James, in full
court, and with a number of church dignitaries
present, received the four professors of divinity in
the universities, who represented the petitioners.
The King prided himself on his polemical powers;
he argued dogmatically, browbeat the professors—asserting
his superior knowledge of divinity, and
declared that uniformity should be enforced under
severe pains and penalties. And the lay and
ecclesiastical dignitaries present vied with each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>other in fulsome adulation. One bishop went on
his knees, and thanked God for having given
them a king with such divine inspiration as the
world had not witnessed since Christ! The
discomfited Puritans withdrew amidst the jeers
and laughter of the servile court.</p>

<p class='c006'>But through the later years of James’s reign,
and throughout the whole of his son’s reign,
puritanism grew, and threatened to either modify
or to disintegrate the English Church. A
calvinistic divine, George Abbot, was even
appointed Archbishop of Canterbury;<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> and many
holding church livings were virtually nonconformists.
A system of doctrines, which denied
the divine right of kings to govern as above the
law, was hateful to Charles Stuart. And the
Queen, Henrietta Maria of France, was a rigid
Catholic; she detested the Puritans, and had
inherited from her father high notions of absolute
rule; and all through Charles’s life she goaded
him on in the dangerous path which issued in his
destruction. And Laud, almost a Catholic in
opinion, and as intolerant as any Spanish
inquisitor, directed the affairs of the Church;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>whilst Strafford was scheming for royal despotism,
and to undermine the privileges of Parliament.
Clergymen preaching absolute obedience were
sure of preferment; the more zealous advocates of
<i>Thorough</i> were made bishops.</p>

<p class='c006'>An old levy on the maritime towns and counties,
to equip vessels for the protection of the coasts in
time of war, was, in time of peace, and on the
Kings sole authority, extended under the name of
ship-money to inland counties, and applied—not
to the equipment of a fleet, but to the support of
a standing army; and, before this army, all
constitutional privileges were to be swept away.
In 1637, a Buckinghamshire gentleman, John
Hampden, refused to pay the guinea-and-a-half
levied on his estate; but the Court of Exchequer
upheld the tax.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, hunted and persecuted, dragged before
Laud’s High Commission on the most paltry
charges, and by it subjected to fines, to personal
injuries and imprisonment, many Puritans
emigrated; some went to Holland, but the
greater number to America: and these became a
considerable factor in shaping the social, political,
and religious history of the Greater Britain
beyond the Atlantic. Three men who came to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>be of special note in our home history—John
Hampden, John Pym, and Oliver Cromwell, were
on board, bound for New England, when a
government order came to stop the sailing of the
vessel.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the Scots were threatening Northumberland,
the King was at his wit’s end to raise
money to pay his troops, and, as a last resource,
he summoned a parliament. The objects were
declared in the opening speech to be, to put down
the Scots by the sword, and to raise money to pay
the costs which had already been incurred in the
war. To rouse their patriotism, the King read
an intercepted letter from the Lords of the
Covenant to the French King, asking for
assistance, in the name of the old alliance between
the two countries. But the appeal fell flat, the
English Commons looked upon the Scottish
insurgents more as allies than as enemies, and
with kindred grievances to be redressed. So
they would grant the King no money until they
had settled other matters with him; and after
eighteen days spent in wrangling, he called them
to the bar of the House of Lords, and haughtily
dismissed them.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile, the Scots holding Newcastle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>commanded the coal supply of London; and they
took possession of Durham, Darlington, and
Northallerton. Every town in which the Blue
Bonnets appeared, received them kindly, and
they kept strict discipline, occupying a good deal
of their time in psalm singing and hearing
sermons. They professed loyalty to the king,
declaring that they had come only as humble
petitioners to be allowed to retain their Presbyterian
Kirk. Against such meek and harmless
invaders, Charles could not raise an effective
war-cry; he found that his troops were lukewarm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>in his cause; he was strongly urged to come to
terms with them, and he appointed commissioners
to arrange a treaty. The Scots were meantime,
from a loan raised by the citizens of London, to
have £40,000 a month for their maintenance.</p>

<p class='c006'>And for the second time in this year (1640)
Charles was obliged to call a Parliament. It met
in November, and—existing for nineteen years—is
known in history as the Long Parliament. Its
first session was marked by the imprisonment of
Laud, and the impeachment of Strafford for
treason against the liberties of the people.
Strafford defended himself with great ability, and
Pym, who conducted the impeachment, fearing
his prey would escape him, got the Commons to
pass a Bill of Attainder—a measure for the
destruction of those for whose real or imputed
offences the law had provided no penalties.
Under clamour and tumult the Bill was also
passed by the peers, and waited only confirmation
by the king. Charles hesitated—what conscience
he had was pricked at the thought of sacrificing
one whose chief fault had been over-zealous
loyalty to himself, and helping him in his designs.
But a letter from Strafford, asking the king to
leave him to his fate, was enough for Charles;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>he signed the warrant, and Strafford was, in May
1641, beheaded on Tower Hill. Laud was for four
years detained in prison, and was then executed.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Civil War.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>In the early part of 1642, matters between the
king and Parliament had become so strained, that
both sides began to make preparations for war.
On January 4th, Charles had in person obtruded
into the House of Commons, and made an
abortive attempt to arrest six members, who were
especially obnoxious to him. This overt act of
the kings roused the cry of “privilege,” and in
Parliamentary circles excited general alarm and
resentment. Upon a demand made by Parliament
for the command of the army, the king
broke off all amicable intercourse, and leaving the
capital, raised his standard at Nottingham, having
under him an army of ten thousand men.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Parliament raised a larger, but a less
disciplined and less ably officered, army. On
October 23rd, at Edgehill, in Warwickshire, for
the first time since the overthrow, by Henry of
Lancaster, of Richard the Third at Bosworth, in
1485, a battle was fought between Englishmen.
The advantage was with the King; and so,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>generally, was the campaign of the following year,
1643. He defeated a Parliamentary army at
Newbury in Berkshire, and his dashing nephew,
Prince Rupert, took Bristol by assault; but he
failed to take Gloucester, and lost a second battle
at Newbury. Meantime, Cromwell was beginning
to take a foremost place as a military
disciplinarian and strategist—holding the rank of
general of cavalry; his will and purpose came to
dominate the entire Parliamentary army.</p>

<p class='c006'>Charles came to Scotland to try to win over the
Covenanters to help him against his Parliament.
He would almost go the length of renouncing
episcopacy, and he ratified the deeds of the
Glasgow Assembly. But the Scots were on good
terms with the English Parliament, and were
even sanguine of extending the presbyterian
covenant into England, where an anti-prelatical
spirit was, under the now assertive puritanism,
rapidly rising.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 1st of July, 1643, an assembly of
divines from both countries, convoked by Parliament,
met in Westminster Abbey. It was
composed of men of learning, of zealous piety and
strong purpose; but they were also men of their
own time, sharing in its prejudices, its intolerance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>and its admixture of dogmatic theology with the
politics and the partizanship of the day. The
grand truths, that God alone is Lord of the
conscience, and that it is as vain to try to fix and
arrest opinions as it is to fix the direction of the
winds, or to arrest the tides, had not then come
to be rooted in the minds of men. For four
years the Assembly sat, arguing and discussing
all the points in orthodox theology, and the
various forms of church government. The fruits
of the “great consult,” are in the form of
documents which are still the recognised standards
of presbyterian faith and worship throughout the
world. In August, 1647, the Scottish commissioners
reported the results to the Edinburgh
General Assembly, and these results were
received as the basis of uniformity in faith, to be
established throughout the three kingdoms.</p>

<p class='c006'>In England, the principle of Presbyterian
church government was endorsed by Parliament,
and a General Assembly and provincial synods
were nominally appointed. But, on the one
hand, the Anglican Church had many influential
supporters; it had now been established for over
a century, and had struck its roots deeply in the
land; its supporters were by their opponents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>called <i>Erastians</i>, from a German doctor Erastus,
who had advocated the subjection of the church
to the state. On the other hand were the
Independents, who stood out against enforced
uniformity, and against any established creed or
ritual. To allow of unrestrained latitudinarianism
in religious opinions, seemed to the rigid
presbyterians disloyalty to the faith,—servility
to antichrist. Loudly and rancorously did this
controversy rage; the more that the principle of
uniformity was pressed, the more did independency
branch out into protests against this
principle, in new sects—each one more self-assertive
than its neighbours. The political
destinies of England were now under the arbitrament
of the sword, and religious dominancy
would be with supremacy in arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Scotland in 1644-5, blazed like a terrific
meteor, the course of James Graham, Marquis of
Montrose. He had been a Covenanter—vehement,
as his nature ever was—but through
jealousy of Argyle and other nobles, he took the
King’s side. He raised an army of Irishmen and
Highlanders, and at Perth, Aberdeen, and
Inverlochy in Argyleshire, he defeated troops
superior in numbers and discipline, by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>fierceness of his onsets, and rapid strokes of
strategy. Pursued by superior forces, he doubled
like a hare, meeting and defeating his enemies in
detachments, in Nairnshire, at Aldearn in
Aberdeenshire, and at Kilsyth near Glasgow,
thus achieving six successive victories. At
Philiphaugh, near Stirling, he was surprised and
defeated by General Leslie. He fled from
Scotland, but returning in 1650, he was made
prisoner, taken to Edinburgh and hanged. He
was able and energetic,—with the genius of a
Napoleon for war,—idolised by his men, but
cruel and vindictive to his enemies.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before Philiphaugh, Charles had been defeated
at Naseby, and his cause on the field was
irretrievably lost. After holding Oxford for a
time, he placed himself under the protection of the
Scottish Army, which—in the pay of the English
Parliament—was at Newark. He was received
with respect—and attempts were again made to
induce him to subscribe to the Covenant. What
the Scots chiefly cared for was the security of
their national church; but Charles was wedded to
episcopacy, as that form of church government
which best accorded with his notions of royal
authority; so he diverged from the presbyterians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>on a point which they considered of vital importance.
The English parliament demanded
the surrender of Charles, promising his safety and
respectful treatment,—expressing indignation at
any suspicion of evil designs against him.</p>

<p class='c006'>And we now come to an event which Scottish
historians must ever approach with hesitation and
misgivings. The Scots gave up the King, it is
said by his own desire; and this just as, after
long delays, they were being paid £400,000, the
arrears then due of their maintenance money.
This has generally been looked upon as an actual
sale of the King to his enemies; certainly it was
a suspicious circumstance, the simultaneous
occurrence of the two transactions. But the one
was not made an express condition for the other;
the money was due under agreement; and the
Scots were tired of the King’s presence amongst
them; he was rather an unmanageable guest—obstinate,
unreliable, and bringing them into
conflict with the English parliament, and its
formidable and now masterful army.</p>

<p class='c006'>The King was placed in Holdenby Castle, and
parliament, in carrying out their promises to the
Scots, opened negotiations for restoring his
authority, under certain restrictions; and having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>sent the Scottish army home, they tried to
disband the English army. But that army was
now master of the situation—it had Cromwell at
its head, and retorted upon the parliament with
a demand for the dismissal of the presbyterian
leaders—and claimed for itself the right of remodelling
the government. Powerless for
resistance, the House of Commons had to yield,
and the government of England became a
military despotism. A Captain Joyce, with a
troop of horse, acting under secret orders from
Cromwell, seized the King’s person, and took him
to Hampton Court. From there, on 11th
November, 1647, he made his escape; he reached
the Isle of Wight, in hopes of being able to cross
the Channel; but was obliged to take refuge in
Carisbrook Castle; he was not kept a close
prisoner, but was allowed to ride and walk about
the island.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the neighbouring town of Newport, the
Royalists negotiated a treaty with the Scots,
engaging for the King to confirm presbyterianism
in Scotland; the Scots to send an army into
England to co-operate with the Royalists. In the
summer of 1648, a Scottish army under Hamilton
entered England, but were defeated by Cromwell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>at Preston. A strong party in Scotland had
repudiated the Newport treaty; the meeting of
the Estates had removed from office all who had
accepted its engagements. At this time the King
and the English Parliament, both confronted by
the army, were approaching each other, and
Parliament was about to vote that the King’s
concessions were satisfactory. But Cromwell
sent Colonel Pride with his troopers to surround
the House of Commons, and prevent the entrance
of the Presbyterian members. Some two hundred
were thus excluded, and the independent members
voted thanks to Cromwell, and gave his after-proceedings
the colour of legality. Within eight
weeks thereafter, the headsman’s axe put an end
to Charles’s troubles.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='ch19' class='c004'>Scotland under Cromwell.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>A Scottish deputation visited the younger
Charles at the Hague. After a good deal
of finessing it was agreed that Charles would be
accepted as King of Scotland, conditionally,—on
the side of the deputation, that he subscribed the
Covenant; and on his side, that the Scots should
furnish an army to help him in the assertion of his
English rights. He signed the Covenant before
landing at the mouth of the Spey, in June, 1650.
Cromwell again proved himself the man of the
hour. He had just stamped out with an iron
heel a rebellion in Ireland; and, within a month
from the landing of Charles, he and his Irish
army had crossed the Tweed, and were marching
on Edinburgh.</p>

<p class='c006'>He had as his opponent the cautious old
veteran, General Leslie. Leslie caused the
country in the line of Cromwell’s march to be laid
waste. The Ironsides had to contend with an
enemy against which their indomitable charges in
the field were of no avail,—famine. Leslie’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>tactics were to avoid a battle; but he hovered
menacingly round Cromwell, maintaining the
more favourable positions. The Lord-General
saw no way out of his difficulty, but either
surrender or a fool-hardy attack on the strong,
well-posted Scottish army. Hemmed in on the
shore near Dunbar, but in communication with
his ships, he was arranging to send off his camp
baggage by sea, and then, by a sudden attack
with his horse, to cut his way through the Scottish
army, when the mis-timed zeal of the Presbyterian
preachers solved the difficulty for him. “Go
down and smite your enemies,” these preachers
shouted, and Leslie’s safer generalship was borne
down by the clamour. On a stormy morning—the
3rd of September, 1650—the Scots descended
to the open plains. Cromwell at the sight
exclaimed, “The Lord hath delivered them into
our hands.” The wet and weary Scots, not
allowed time to form in proper order of battle,
were totally routed; thousands falling in the
battle and the flight.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the news of the defeat reached
Edinburgh, the magistrates fled to the headquarters
of the Scottish army at Stirling. Four
days after the battle, Cromwell took possession of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>the city, but it was not till the end of December
that the castle surrendered. Other fortresses,
Glasgow, and all Scotland south of the Forth,
submitted to Cromwell. But the Scottish army
was so strongly posted at Stirling that he did not
attempt to dislodge it. In the western shires, a
party calling themselves Remonstrators, opposed
to Charles, and also to Cromwell and his army of
Independents, raised an army of about four
thousand men, and attacked a body of English
troops at Hamilton. They were at first successful,
but through their very success they got into
disorder, and were ultimately defeated.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Scottish Parliament, having retired beyond
the Forth, now ordered that Charles should be
crowned at Scone. He was residing in Perth,
and had been so preached at, prayed for, and
pelted with good advice, that his patience became
exhausted, and one day he made a bolt for the
highlands. He reached Clova, a village amongst
the Grampians, expecting to find there a large
concourse of Royalists, pure and simple. But
very few such met him, and he returned to Perth
with a small party which had been sent after him.</p>

<p class='c006'>On 1st January, 1651, the coronation took
place. A sermon was preached, in which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>insincerity of the Stuart family was a leading
topic. Then Charles swore to the Covenants,
and to the maintenance of the Presbyterian Kirk,
and he was duly crowned and annointed King of
Scotland. Thereafter, not being lacking in
personal courage, he took a more prominent place
in the field. He was sadly in want of money.
The Edinburgh mint was in the hands of the
English; a mint was established in Dundee—then
well fortified—but there was a scanty supply
for coinage of the precious metals.</p>

<p class='c006'>The records of the Dundee Town Council give
a letter from the king dated from Dunfermline,
May 12th, 1651, asking the town to advance by
way of a royal loan, one thousand pounds sterling;
but the King’s personal security was then of
doubtful value, and the Estates having passed an
Act ordering all the lieges to contribute voluntarily
for the necessities of the army, the cautious
Dundonians at once entered into such a contribution.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile, the northern passes being strictly
guarded, Cromwell sent gunboats up the Forth.
These were beaten off at Burntisland; but at
Queensferry they effected a landing of Commonwealth
troops, and Cromwell made his way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>through Fife, and took Perth. He thus gained a
commanding position in the rear of the Scottish
army. But his northerly movement left for the
Royalists a clear way into England; and Charles
expected to find many friends there. So with
the Scottish army he entered England by
Carlisle; and, by rapid marches, in three weeks
from leaving Stirling he reached Worcester. In
hot pursuit, to give no time for raising a Royalist
army, Cromwell followed the king. He left
General Monk with a small army to complete the
subjugation of Scotland.</p>

<p class='c006'>Six days after Charles arrived at Worcester,
Cromwell was there, at the head of thirty
thousand men. On the 3rd of September—being
the anniversary of the battle of Dunbar—a
desperate battle was fought on the banks of the
Severn, and the inferior Scottish army—for comparatively
few English Royalists had joined on
the march—was utterly routed. Three thousand
Scots were slain in the battle, and ten thousand
were made prisoners; the majority of these were
barbarously shipped off to the plantations, and
sold into slavery. After many adventures and
narrow escapes, Charles contrived to reach
France. For eight years he was a hanger-on at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>various continental courts, and looked upon as a
hopeless claimant to thrones which had vanished
from the earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Cromwell left Scotland, Dundee was
almost the only fortified town which held for the
king. Many Royalists, with their valuables, had
taken refuge therein. In anticipation of an attack
by the English gunboats, heavy guns were placed
on the river frontage, and other means of defence
were hurriedly adopted. A committee of the
Estates sat in the town; and when, in the middle
of August, General Monk, with four thousand
horse and foot, appeared before it and demanded
its surrender, this committee issued a defiant
proclamation, and then decamped to Alyth, a
little town about eighteen miles to the north of
Dundee, carrying with them a considerable
amount of public money. Monk, by a sudden
swoop, captured the committee; some, and amongst
them the veteran General Leslie, were killed; the
others were sent to the Tower of London, and the
troopers enriched themselves by their plunder.</p>

<p>THE PROTECTOR OLIVER CROMWELL.<br />(<i>From a painting by Vandyke.</i>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On 1st September, after a fortnight’s
bombardment, Dundee was taken by assault.
Monk had had a training in military savagery
under Cromwell in Ireland, and he now beat the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>record of his master. Not only was the brave
governor Lumsden—after quarter had been given
him—with eight hundred of the garrison, put to
death in cold blood, but it is said that two
hundred women and children shared the same
fate. Carlyle, without any note of disapproval,
says: “Governor Lumsden would not yield on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>summons; General Monk stormed him; the town
took fire in the business; there was once more a
grim scene, of flame and blood, and rage and
despair, transacted on this earth.” It is said that
the plunder of the town exceeded two-and-a-half
million pounds, Scots (£125,000 sterling.) There
were sixty vessels in the harbour. After the fall
of Dundee, Montrose, Aberdeen, and St. Andrews
surrendered, and Monk was, for Cromwell, master
of Scotland.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Cromwell was now virtually sovereign of
England and Ireland also. After disbanding,
with taunts and insults, the Long Parliament,—as
a servant of which he had risen to power,—and
playing for a little while with a mock parliament,
composed of his own adherents, he found himself
strong enough to govern without a parliament.
At an assembly of notables—1653—General
Lambert, in the name of the army and the three
kingdoms, asked him to accept the office of Lord
Protector of the Commonwealth. With real or
assumed reluctance he gave his consent; he took
the oath of office, put on his hat, sat down in a
chair of state, and Lambert, on his knees, presented
to him the great seal. With more ample authority
than had ever been possessed by their legitimate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>monarchs, he governed these islands till his death.
This event occurred in 1658, on the 3rd of
September, the anniversary of his Dunbar and
Worcester victories.</p>

<p class='c006'>And so this great personality departed. He
was only in his sixtieth year, and up to his last
year he had appeared strong and healthy. But
as Carlyle says,—“Incessant toil, inconceivable
labour of head, and heart, and hand; toil, peril,
and sorrow manifold, continued for near twenty
years now, had done their part; those robust
life-energies had been gradually eaten out. Like
a tower strong to the eye, but with its foundations
undermined, the fall of which on any shock may
be sudden.” We might add to the above causes
for what seemed premature decline, his knowledge
that he had a host of bitter and deadly enemies,
ever plotting against his life. To live in constant
dread of assassination, will eat as a canker into
the bravest of hearts.</p>

<p class='c006'>His character has been diversely estimated,
according to the standpoint of the critic. To a
strong believer in force of will and energy of
purpose, like the writer quoted above, he is
England’s greatest soldier, statesman, and ruler.
Others have called him hypocrite,—dogmatic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>vindictive, cruel to ferocity. Of his administrative
abilities, his unswerving resolution, and his military
genius, there can hardly be two opinions. Under
his government there was peace and order, social
progress, and comparative freedom at home;
abroad, the Commonwealth achieved high honour
and respect. As a victorious soldier, Cromwell
shewed little magnanimity towards the vanquished.
Retaliation and revenge were common faults of
the times—say his apologists; yes, but a truly
noble character will rise above the sins and
shortcomings of his times; he will be the prophet
and pioneer of better times.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to Cromwell’s religious professions, they
were doubtless sincere, but men make their gods
after their own hearts, and his god was the
Jehovah of the old Hebrews; a god of war and
of vengeance, rather than the All-Merciful Father
of the Sermon on the Mount. Macaulay has said
of the theologically-flavoured political writings of
the Puritans, that one might think their authors
had never read the New Testament at all, so full
were they of “smiting the Amalekites,” of
“hewing Agag to pieces,” and of the hard and
bitter spirit of the older times. Can we wonder
that the mind of the Prince of the Puritans had,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>unconsciously perhaps, run in the same narrow
groove?</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the Scottish rule of “His Highness, the
Lord Protector,” it may be said that after a long
period of conflict and general unsettledness, it was
a time of peace. The laws were administered,
even amongst highland hills and border wastelands.
Monk, with a small army, and a few forts
garrisoned by English troops, managed, after
their several defeats, to keep a brave, and
naturally a patriotic and freedom-loving people, in
thorough subjection. They did not love the man;
but, although he would not allow the General
Assembly to sit, their church had that freedom of
worship which under a Covenanted king they had
failed to accomplish. There were two leading
Presbyterian parties, the <i>Resolutionists</i>, who had
placed the Scottish crown on the head of Charles,
and still called themselves king’s men, praying for
him in the public devotions; and the <i>Remonstrators</i>,
who had never, in spite of all his oaths and promises,
adopted or believed in Charles, and studiously
kept him out of their prayers. (One might have
thought that the worse a man he was, the more
he needed praying for). Cromwell favoured the
latter party, making a certificate from three or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>four of its ministers the condition of a minister,
although he might be called to a church, being
paid his stipend. Cromwell taxed the Scots very
heavily, but perhaps, all considered, they got fair
value for their money. On the whole, so far as
Scotland was concerned, we may indorse what, in
his <cite>History of his own Time</cite>, Bishop Burnet says
of the Protectorate generally:—“There was good
justice done, and vice was suppressed and punished.
So that we always reckon those eight years of
Usurpation a time of great peace and prosperity.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>At the death of Cromwell there was not, in
the general aspect of political matters, any
definite forecast of what twelve months after
would be the form of government; certainly an
easy and unopposed restoration of the Stuart
monarchy was about the last idea, warranted by
the history of the previous fifteen years. But one
man, the still-tongued, close-minded General
Monk, solved the question. By his influence as
head of the army, and his tact and sagacity in
party wire-pulling, he so managed that within
eight months of the Protector’s death, Charles II.
was quietly proclaimed King of Great Britain and
Ireland. It was a twenty-seven years of as mean
rule, as has ever darkened the pages of British
history. Retaliations and persecutions—one long
attempt to turn back the stream of progress—a
corrupt court, leavening the national life with
foulness and frivolity, such might be the general
headings of the chapters chronicling the reign of
the “Merry Monarch.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>The restoration was in England baptized in
blood. Ten “regicides” were hanged at Charing
Cross. This was harsh—revengeful; but not
despicable or unprecedented. But it is with
disgust, with shame for our common humanity,
that we learn that the bodies of Cromwell, Ireton,
and Bradshaw were taken from their graves in
Westminster Abbey, and on the death anniversary
(30th January) of “King Charles the Martyr,”
drawn on hurdles to Tyburn, and there hung on
the gallows; then the heads cut off and fixed on
Westminster Hall.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Scotland must not be left without examples
of severity. The Marquis of Argyle was the first
victim. At the coronation of Charles at Scone,
he was the noble who placed the crown on the
king’s head. But Charles hated him as a leader
of the presbyterians, who then held him in
irksome tutelage. After a most unfair trial,
nothing tangible being found against him except
some private letters to General Monk, in which he
expressed himself favourable to Cromwell, he was
found guilty, and condemned to death. He met
his fate with great firmness, saying that if he
could not brave death like a Roman, he could
submit to it like a Christian.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Other victims followed. Swinburne has said
of Mary of Scotland, “A kinder or more faithful
friend, a deadlier or more dangerous enemy, it
would be impossible to dread or to desire.”
Mary’s descendants were noways remarkable for
fidelity in friendship, but they were implacable in
their hatreds. When he was in the over-careful
hands of the Covenanters, Charles had treasured
up against a day of vengeance, many affronts,
brow-beatings, and intimidations, and now he
meant, in his stubborn way, to demand payment,
with heavy interest, of the old debts.</p>

<p class='c006'>And so Charles, the Covenanted King of
Scotland, and in whose cause its best blood had
been shed, had nothing but hatred for the land of
his fathers, and for its presbyterian faith. A
packed and subservient Scottish Parliament
proceeded to pass, first a Rescissory Act,
rescinding all statutes, good and bad, which had
been passed since the commencement of the civil
wars; and next, an Act of Supremacy, making
the king supreme judge in all matters, both civil
and ecclesiastical. Charles soon made it evident
that he meant to establish episcopacy. James
Sharpe, minister of the little Fifeshire town of
Crail, was sent to London to look after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>presbyterian interests; he was got at on the
selfish side, and made archbishop of St. Andrews.
Nine other pliant Scottish ministers received
episcopal ordination in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the third anniversary of the Restoration,
29th May, 1662, copies of the Covenants were in
Edinburgh publicly torn to pieces by the common
hangman. The ministers were ordered to attend
diocesan meetings, and to acknowledge the
authority of their bishops. The majority acquiesced;
but it is pleasing to learn that nearly
four hundred resigned their livings, rather than
submit to the prelatic yoke. To take the places
of the <i>recusants</i>, a hosts of <i>curates</i>, often persons
of mean character and culture, were ordained.
The people did not like the men thus thrust upon
them as ministers, and they still sought the
services of their old pastors; hence originated the
“conventicles,” a contemptuous title for a meeting-place
of dissenters.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now began, chiefly in the west and south
of Scotland, those field meetings which afterwards
became so notable. At first they were simply
assemblies for worship, no arms were worn; after
service a quiet dispersal. But, as signifying
nonconformity to prescribed forms, they gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>great offence. A new Act forbade, under
punishment for sedition, any preaching without
the sanction of the bishops; and inflicting pains
and penalties on all persons absenting themselves
from their parish churches. If fines were not
paid, soldiers were quartered on the recusants,
and their cattle, furniture, and very clothing were
sold. It was even accounted seditious to give
sustenance to the ejected ministers.</p>

<p class='c006'>It can be easily asked, why did this Scottish
people, with the memory of their past, submit to
these things? There was, as in England, a
reaction to an extreme of loyalty; there was the
satisfaction of finding themselves freed from
English domination in its tangible form of
Cromwell’s troops and garrisons; there was the
pleasure of once more seeing a Parliament in
Edinburgh, even though it merely registered and
gave legal form to the king’s decrees. They
were told that the advantage of being governed
by their own native prince implied as its price
the establishment of that prince’s form of religious
faith. Their own nobles and many of their
ministers had conformed; and thus bereft of their
natural leaders, there was weakness and division.
Despite of all these discouragements, they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>often goaded into insurrections; which were
cruelly suppressed, and made the excuses for
further intolerance, and still harsher persecutions.</p>

<p class='c006'>The field conventicles continued. In the
solitudes of nature, in lonely glens, or on pine-shaded
hillsides, with sentinels posted on the
heights, arose the solemn psalm, and the preachers
prayer and exhortation. And men now came
armed to these gatherings, the women had to be
defended, force was to be met by force. To
suppress such meetings, troops were sent into the
insubordinate districts, under a wild fanatical
Royalist, General Dalziel, and had free quarters
on the inhabitants. By 1666, a reign of terror
was fully inaugurated; Dalziel flared like a baleful
meteor over the West of Scotland. In November
of this year, without concert or premeditation,
an open insurrection broke out. At Dalry, in
Ayrshire, four soldiers were grossly maltreating
an aged man, and common humanity could not
stand by and look on with indifference or mere
sympathy. The people rescued the old man,
disarmed the soldiers, and took their officer
prisoner to Dumfries. A resolution was suddenly
taken to march on Edinburgh. They gathered
in a fortnight’s march to barely 2000 men, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>wearied and worn out, encamped on a plateau,
called Rullion Green, on the Pentland hills, a few
miles south of Edinburgh. Here they were
attacked by double their numbers under Dalziel,
and, after a gallant resistance, considering their
inferior arms and discipline, were put to flight.
Some fifty were killed on the field, one hundred
and thirty were taken prisoners, thirty-four of
whom were, chiefly at the instigation of Archbishop
Sharpe, hanged as rebels, and the rest banished.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THUMBIKINS.<br />(<i>From the Scottish Antiquarian Museum.</i>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And tortures—such as have had no place in
modern history since the palmy days of the
Spanish Inquisition were inflicted to extort
confessions of complicity in a rising, which was
really the offspring of momentary excitement.
<i>Thumbikins</i> squeezed the fingers by iron screws.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>These tortures were generally borne with heroic
patience and resolution. One young minister,
Hugh McKail, comely in person, well educated,
an enthusiast in his covenanting faith, was
subjected to the torture of the <i>boot</i>. His leg was
crushed, but he uttered no cry, only moving his
lips in silent prayer. He had taken very little
part in the insurrection, but was condemned to
death. On the gallows-ladder his last words
were:—“Farewell father, mother, and all my
friends in life, farewell earth and all its delights,
farewell sun, moon, and stars, welcome death,
glory, and eternal life.” Seeing what impressions
such words made on the listeners, in after
executions drums were beaten to drown the voices
of the sufferers.</p>

<p class='c006'>A weary ten years ensued of alternate
“indulgence,” and renewed intolerance. In 1667,
the Duke of Lauderdale was placed at the head
of Scottish affairs. He had subscribed to the
covenant, and had been a Presbyterian representative
at the Westminster Assembly. He was
now a subservient courtier, but did not at first
assume the role of a persecutor. He disbanded
the army, and proclaimed an indemnity to those
who had fought at Rullion Green, on their signing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>a bond of peace. The ministers ousted from
their parishes were permitted to return, but on
conditions which the strict consciences of many
could not accept; and those who did accept were
placed under close surveillance, and under severe
penalties forbidden to take part in any field
meetings. Some of the bishops were good men,
striving earnestly to make peace within the
church. One of these, Leighton, Bishop of
Dunblane, made an attempt to reconcile Presbyterianism
with a modified episcopacy. The
bishops were merely to sit as chairmen, or
moderators, in the diocesan convocations, and to
have no veto on the proceedings, but the
Covenanters thought this a snare for entrapping
them into an acknowledgment of prelacy, and
the idea was abandoned.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Lauderdale who had begun his rule
leniently, now afraid of being represented to the
King as lukewarm in his service, blossomed out
into a cruel persecutor, forcibly suppressing field
meetings, and enforcing extreme penalties on
nonconformists. It has been estimated that up
to this date seventeen thousand persons had
suffered in fine, imprisonment, and death. It was
said that fines extorted for non-attendance at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>parish churches, were applied to supply the
extravagance of Lady Lauderdale,—a rapacious,
bad, clever woman. Landowners were required
under penalties to become bound for their tenants,
that they would attend their parish churches, take
no part in conventicles, and not relieve outlawed
persons.</p>

<p class='c006'>The gentry generally refused to enter into
such bonds; and Lauderdale wrote to the King
that the country was in a state of incipient
rebellion, and required reduction by force of arms.
He treated the whole of the west country as if in
open revolt. Not only did he send ordinary
troops with field artillery into the devoted districts,
but he brought down from the hills a Highland
host of 9000 men to live upon, and with every
encouragement to plunder and oppress, the poor
people. Speaking an unknown tongue, strange
in manners and attire, they were to the lowlanders
a veritable plague of human locusts. When, after
a few months of free quarterage, they went back
to their hills, themselves and a number of horses
were loaded with booty, as if from the sack of a
rich town. But so far as we can learn they were
not guilty of personal violence upon those they
were sent to despoil; perhaps in this respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>hardly coming up to the wishes and expectations
of their employers.</p>

<p class='c006'>In May, 1679, occurred a deed of blood which
widened the gulf between the Covenanters and
the government, and gave legal colouring to
harshness and persecution. In Fifeshire, one
Carmichael had become especially obnoxious as
a cruel persecutor, and an active commissioner for
receiving the fines laid upon the malcontents.
On 3rd May, a party of twelve men, chiefly small
farmers in the district, with David Hackston of
Rathillet and John Balfour of Burley as the
leaders, lay in wait for Carmichael, with full
purpose to slay him. It appears he had received
some warning, and kept out of the way. After
waiting long, the band were, in sullen disappointment,
preparing to separate, when the carriage of
Sharpe, the Archbishop, appeared unexpectedly,
conveying him and his daughter home to St.
Andrews. To these superstitious men, nursed
under persecution by old biblical texts into
religious fanaticism, it appeared as if an act of
necessary vengeance was here thrust upon them,
that instead of an inferior agent, a foremost
persecutor, who had hounded to the death many
of their brethren, was now delivered into their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>hands. They took him from his carriage, and
there on Magus Muir—suing upon his knees for
mercy, his grey hairs, and his daughter’s anguished
cries, also pleading for his life—they slew him
with many sword thrusts.</p>

<p class='c006'>A general cry of horror and repudiation rang
through the land. It was a savage murder; but
so had been the deaths of hundreds of persons
more innocent than he of offences against justice
and common right. More severe measures of
repression were taken; new troops were raised,
and the officers instructed to act with the utmost
rigour. And the Covenanters grew desperate;
they assembled in greater numbers, were more
fully armed, and more defiant in their language.
On 29th May, the anniversary of the Restoration,
a mounted party entered the village of Rutherglen,
about two miles from Glasgow. They
extinguished the festive bonfire, held a service of
denunciatory psalms, prayers, and exhortations in
the market place, and burned the Acts which had
been issued against the Covenant. In quest of the
insurgents, and to avenge the affront on the
government, a body of cavalry rode out of
Glasgow barracks, on the 1st of June. Their
leader was a distinguished soldier—a man of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>courage and gallant bearing, John Graham of
Claverhouse—afterwards, for his services in the
royal cause, created Viscount Dundee.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the annals of Scotland there is no name
amongst the unworthiest of her sons,—Monteith
the betrayer of Wallace, Cardinal Beaton, the
ruthless persecutor, Dalziel, with a monomania
for murder and oppression,—so utterly detestable
as that of the dashing cavalier, Claverhouse.
His portrait is that of a haughty, self-centred
man; one would think too proud for the meanly
savage work he was set to do, but which, with fell
intensity, he seemed to revel in doing. In the
conflict, he appeared to have a charmed life, and
in these superstitious times he was believed
to have made a paction with Satan:—for doing
the fiend’s work he was to have so many years
immunity from death: neither lead nor steel
could harm him. It was said that his mortal
wound, received in the moment of victory at
Killiecrankie, was from being shot by a silver
bullet.</p>

<p class='c006'>Claverhouse, in quest of the demonstrators at
Rutherglen, came, at Drumclog, about twenty
miles south of Glasgow, on the body of insurgents;
about fifty horsemen fairly well appointed, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>many infantry with fire-arms, and a number
armed with pikes, scythes, and pitch-forks. The
Covenanters had skilfully posted themselves; a
morass and broad ditch in front, the infantry in
the centre, a troop of horse on each flank.
Claverhouse’s call to surrender was answered by
the singing of a verse of a warlike psalm. The
troops gave a loud cheer, and rode into the
morass; they found it impassable and themselves
under a steady fire from the Covenanters.
Claverhouse sent flanking parties to right and
left. These were boldly met before they had
time to form after crossing the ditch, and nearly
cut to pieces. And then the Covenanters made a
sudden rush, and after a desperate defence by
Claverhouse, they utterly routed him,—the only
battle he ever lost.</p>

<p class='c006'>This victory of the Covenanters over regular
troops, ably commanded, was a general surprise,
and it found the victors ill-prepared to follow it
up to advantage. They next day occupied
Hamilton, and, reinforced by numbers, proceeded
to attack Glasgow. They were at first beaten
back by Claverhouse, but he thought it advisable
to retreat to Edinburgh; and then the insurgents
occupied Glasgow. The King meanwhile had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>sent the Duke of Monmouth—a courteous
and courageous gentleman,—albeit the bar
sinister ran through his escutcheon—to collect
an army to quell the rebellion. On 21st
June the Covenanters—who had now their headquarters
near Hamilton, on the south-western
bank of the Clyde, learned that the Duke, at the
head of a powerful army, was advancing towards
Bothwell Bridge—crossing which he would be
upon them.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the face of the common enemy, polemical
disputes between the different presbyterian
parties brought confusion into their councils.
The moderate party drew up a supplication to
the Duke, describing their many grievances, and
asking that they be submitted to a free parliament.
The Duke sent a courteous reply,
expressing sympathy, and offering to intercede
for them with the King,—but they must first lay
down their arms. This condition the extreme
party would not listen to, and at this most
unsuitable moment, they nominated fresh officers—men
indisposed to acknowledge any allegiance
to the King, or, in matters appertaining to
religion, to submit to the civil power.  Under
Rathillet, Burley and other irreconcilables, 300
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>men were posted to hold the bridge; they made a
stout defence; but it was forced at the point of
the bayonet. Bishop Burnet says,—“The main
body of the insurgents had not the grace to
submit, the courage to fight, nor the sense to run
away.” But when the cannon began to make
havoc in their ranks, and they saw the deadly
array of horsemen, and the serried ranks of
disciplined infantry preparing to charge—they
threw down their arms, and became a mob of
fugitives.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now Claverhouse had to avenge
Drumclog. His war-cry on that day had been
“No Quarter,” and this was his intention at
Bothwell Bridge. Four hundred were killed on
the field and in the flight, but the strict orders of
the Duke were “Give quarter to all who
surrender—make prisoners, but spare life;” and
thus the relentless swords of Claverhouse and
Dalziel were stayed. With the indignation of a
true soldier, Monmouth rejected a proposal to
burn Hamilton and to devastate the surrounding
country; and he issued a proclamation promising
pardon to all who made their submission by a
certain day.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the milder spirit of Monmouth found no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>place in the treatment of the prisoners taken at
Bothwell. They were marched to Edinburgh,
suffering much on the way; there, 1200 men
were huddled together without shelter in the
Greyfriars churchyard—sleeping amongst the
tombs upon the bare ground. Several supposed
leaders were executed, some escaped further
misery by death from exposure, others were set
free on signing a declaration never to take arms
against the King, and 257 were sent as slaves to
Barbadoes.</p>

<p class='c006'>And meantime Claverhouse was passing as a
destroying angel through the western shires.
Making little distinction between those who had,
and those who had not, taken part in the late
insurrection—he seized the property, and imprisoned
or put to death, all against whom any
charge of contumacy could be laid. The hunted
Covenanters were driven into wilder seclusions,
and their barbarous treatment naturally made
them more aggressive and extravagant in their
language. Useless to talk to men frenzied to
despair of loyalty to a King, who, in his life of
unhallowed pleasure in distant London, heard
not, or cared not, for the bitter cry of the people
whose rights he had sworn to protect. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>they met at midnight in lonely glen or trackless
moor, the leaders, Cameron, Cargill, Renwick,
and others, would, like the Hebrew Prophets of
old, mingle prophecy with denunciation; their
high-strung enthusiasm bordered on insanity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cameron and Cargill published a declaration
denouncing Charles, calling on all true sons of
the Covenant to throw off their allegiance, and take
up arms against him. And government had now
a pretext for putting Scotland under what was
really martial law. The common soldiers were
authorised to put to death, without any pretence
of trial, all who refused to take the prescribed
oath, or to answer all interrogations. It was a
capital crime to have any intercourse with prescribed
persons; and torture was inflicted, even
on women, to extort the whereabouts of these
persons. At Wigtown, Margaret McLauchlan, a
widow of sixty-three years, and Margaret Wilson,
a girl of eighteen, were drowned by being bound
to stakes within flood-mark.</p>

<p class='c006'>Amongst many murders perpetrated at this
time, that of John Brown, the Ayrshire carrier,
stands out conspicuous in horror. He was a
quiet, sedate man, leading a blameless life; his
only offence was that he did not on Sundays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>attend the parish church, but either read his bible
at home, or, with a few like-minded, met in a
quiet place for a little service of praise and prayer.
One morning, whilst digging peats for the house
fire, he was surrounded by Claverhouse’s dragoons,
and brought to his own door. Here, his wife and
children being by—a baby in its mother’s arms—Claverhouse
asked him why he did not attend on
the King’s curate; and John, answering that he
had to obey his conscience rather than the King,
Claverhouse told him to prepare for death. He
said he had long been so prepared. He prayed
with fervour, until interrupted by Claverhouse,
who saw his wild dragoons beginning to shew
tokens of sympathy; Brown kissed his wife and
little ones, and he was then shot dead. “What
do you think of your bonnie man now?” the
devil-hearted slayer asked of the newly-made
widow. “I aye thocht muckle o’ him, but never
sae muckle as I do this day.” She laid her infant
on the ground, tied up the poor shattered head in
her kerchief, composed the limbs, covered the
body with a plaid, and then she sat down beside
it, and, in heart-rending sobs and tears, gave full
course to natural sorrow. The tragedy enacted
on Magus Moor was a cruel murder, but if there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>are degrees of guilt in such an awful crime, that
committed at the cottage door in Ayrshire was
surely the more heinous and atrocious of the two.</p>

<p class='c006'>Monmouth remained only a short time in
Scotland; Lauderdale was still nominally at the
head of affairs. But in November, 1679, the
King sent his brother James to Edinburgh, partly
to keep him out of sight from the people of
England. As a rigid Roman Catholic, standing
next in succession to the throne, he was very
unpopular. A cry of popish plots had been got
up, and an Exclusion Bill would have been carried
in Parliament,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> but Charles dissolved it, and he
never called another; for the last four years of his
life he reigned as an absolute monarch.</p>

<p class='c006'>James, a royal Stuart, residing in long
untenanted Holyrood, was made much of by the
Scottish nobility and gentry, and to conciliate
them he so far unbent his generally sombre and
unamiable demeanour. He paid particular
attention to the Highland chieftains, and thus laid
a foundation for that loyalty to himself and his
descendants, so costly to the clansmen. But his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>presence and his influence in public affairs did
no good to the poor Covenanters. Against
nonconformity of every shade his only remedies
were persecution and suppression. The poor
wanderers of the Covenant were hunted as wild
beasts. Richard Cameron was slain at Aire
Moss. Hackston and Cargill were hanged. It
is said that James often amused his leisure hours
by witnessing the tortures of the boot and the
thumb-screw.</p>

<p class='c006'>And not the common people only were thus
vexed and harassed. Strangely-worded oaths,
acknowledging the laws and statutes, and also the
King’s supremacy, were administered to all holding
official positions. When, as a privy counsellor,
the oath was tendered to the Earl of
Argyle—son of the Marquis who was beheaded
at the commencement of the reign—he declared
he took it so far as it was consistent with itself,
and with the Protestant religion. For adding
this qualification, he was tried for, and found
guilty of, high treason. He contrived to escape
from Edinburgh Castle in the disguise of a page
holding up his step-daughter’s train. He reached
Holland, a sentence of death hanging over him.</p>

<p class='c006'>And in England, after dismissing the Oxford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>parliament, the King was despotic. If he had
any religious faith at all, it was towards
Catholicism, and thus he took up his brother’s
quarrel. In the administration of justice, juries
were packed, and judges were venal. London
was adjudged to have illegally extended its
political powers, was fined heavily, and condemned
to lose its charters. Breaches of their
charters by provincial towns were looked for,
and something was generally found sufficient to
raise prosecutions upon, the award being always
given for the Crown. Fines were levied for the
King’s private advantage, and by his veto in the
election of magistrates he held in his hand
Parliamentary elections. The university of Oxford
issued a solemn decree, affirming unlimited
submission to the Royal authority; and the most
detestable of the very few judges whose names
are a stain upon the history of English jurisprudence—Jeffreys—was
the very incarnation of
venality and injustice; he was a vulgar bully,
ever finding a demoniacal pleasure in cruelty and
wrong-doing.</p>

<p class='c006'>The country had been sickened of civil war,
and public spirit seemed to have deserted the land.
Still the Whig leaders of the late majority in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Parliament made some attempts at organizing
resistance. Shaftesbury was for immediate rebellion;
but Lords Essex, Howard, and William
Russell, and Algernon Sidney, more cautiously
resolved to wait the course of events, and act
when an opportunity arose. They certainly
meant an insurrection in London, to be supported
by a rising in the West of England, and another
in Scotland under the Earl of Argyle.</p>

<p class='c006'>But a conspiracy in a lower stratum of political
influence, called the Ryehouse Plot, which proposed
the deaths of the King and his brother,
having been divulged to the Government, and
certain arrests made, the prisoners, to save themselves,
declared that Lords Howard and Russell,
and Sidney, Hampden (a grandson of the John
Hampden of ship-money fame), and others were
implicated. Howard—recreant to the traditions
of his name—turned approver. Lord William
Russell was tried for treason—nobly supported
by his wife—and although the evidence against
him was weak, a packed jury convicted him, and
he was beheaded at Lincoln’s Inn Fields.
Sidney was tried by Judge Jeffreys. Howard
was the only witness against him, and for a
conviction of treason the law required at least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>two witnesses; but a manuscript treatise on
Government had been found amongst Sidney’s
papers; certain passages on political liberty
would nowadays be considered as mere truisms,
but Jeffreys ruled that they were equal to two-and-twenty
adverse witnesses. He also was
found guilty, and was beheaded on Tower Hill.
Shaftesbury fled to Holland. Lord Essex—a
true nobleman—blaming himself for having put
it into Howard’s power to injure Lord Russell,
committed suicide.</p>

<p class='c006'>And some Scottish gentlemen were also
implicated in the Whig plot. Bailie, of Jerviswood,
had been in correspondence with Lord
Russell, and was asked to give evidence against
him. On his refusal, he was himself tried for
treason,—condemned and executed. Many were
fined and imprisoned; many left the country, or
otherwise could not be found, but were tried
in their absence—outlawed, and their estates
forfeited.</p>

<p class='c006'>James returned to London: he feared the
influence of the Duke of Monmouth, who, trading
on his father’s favour and his own handsome face
and genial manners, posed as an ultra-Protestant,
and, in spite of his illegitimate birth, aspired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>to the succession. James had Monmouth sent to
Holland—then, under the Prince of Orange, the
refuge for English and Scottish exiles.</p>

<p class='c006'>But for Charles the world of time was now
at its vanishing point. He was only in his
fifty-fifth year when, in the midst of his sensuous
pleasures, apoplexy seized him, and Bishop Ken
had to tell him his hours were numbered.
Certain religious exercises were gone through,
and the sacramental elements being brought in,
the bishop proposed their administration. The
King put this off, and the bishop retired. And
now James looked up a Catholic priest, and had
him smuggled in by a private door to the King’s
chamber. The King made confession, and had
the last rites of the Church administered. Thus
made safe by a Romish passport into heaven—the
dying King no doubt enjoyed as a good joke
the prayers and admonitions of the Protestant
prelates, who, with the lords-in-waiting, were
afterwards ushered into his chamber. He died
February 6th, 1684-5.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>Within half-an-hour of his brother’s
death, James was seated as the King
in Council. He declared that he would govern
by the laws, and maintain the established church.
Loyal addresses from all parts of his dominions
were poured in upon him; and the commencement
of his reign gave promise of stability and
popularity. In a lesser degree he had his
brothers vices; but he had shewn considerable
aptitude for public business, and was not
deficient in personal courage. In 1665, he had,
in a war with Holland, taken the command of
the Channel fleet. On the 3rd of June a great
battle was fought off the Norfolk coast, within
sight of Lowestoft. When the fight was at its
hottest, the Dutch admiral’s ship blew up, and a
Dutch fire-ship grappled with and destroyed an
English ship. James had twice to shift his flag,
as his ships were successively disabled. After
an obstinate contest the Dutch ships sailed
for the Texel; James pursued for a time,—eighteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>of the enemy’s ships being taken or
destroyed.</p>

<p class='c006'>But his accession to the throne was not to
be unchallenged. The Duke of Monmouth and
the Earl of Argyle met in Holland, and concerted
simultaneous insurrections in England and
Scotland.</p>

<p class='c006'>Monmouth landed at Lyme, in Dorsetshire, on
11th June, and marched to Taunton, in Somersetshire,
at the head of 5,000 irregularly armed
troops. He had married the heiress of Buccleuch,
and in other ways became associated with the
nobility; stories had been set afloat of a marriage
between his father and his Welsh mother, Lucy
Walters, and he was looked on by many as the
true heir to the throne. At Taunton he was
received with acclamations; twenty young ladies
presented him with a pocket-bible, a flag, and a
naked sword. He had himself proclaimed King.
After a good deal of tentative marching through
the western counties, he fell back on Bridgewater,
and three miles from this town, at
Sedgemoor, a battle was fought, in which he
was utterly defeated. He himself fled before
the close of the fight; and was afterwards
captured hiding in a bean-field.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>He was taken to London, and at his own
solicitation had an interview with the King. A
larger-minded man than James would have been
moved to generosity, at the sight of his brother’s
son grovelling on his knees before him, and
humbly suing for mercy; but generosity towards
fallen enemies was not a distinguishing trait in
the Stuart character. And this young man had
long been a thorn in James’s path; so now
no mercy for him—his doom was immediate
execution.</p>

<p class='c006'>And terrible was the vengeance of the King on
not only the leaders of the insurrection, but on
inferior participants, and on all who had given aid
or countenance thereto. There were a number
of military executions; and then Jeffreys was let
loose upon the western counties. His “bloody
assize” was a very devil’s carnival of barbarity
and death. The campaign was opened at
Winchester with the trial of Alice Lisle, the
aged widow of one of Cromwell’s lieutenants,
for affording food and shelter to two of the
fugitive insurgents. Jeffreys bullied the jury
into a verdict of guilty, and then he sentenced
her to be burned alive that same afternoon.
Horror-stricken, the clergy of the cathedral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>obtained a respite for three days. Noble ladies,
whom she had befriended in the time of the
Commonwealth, solicited her pardon from the
King. Her son in the army had served against
Monmouth. And James was actually moved
to change her sentence from burning alive to
beheading! And so it was executed. In this
judicial massacre, more than three hundred
persons were put to death, and very many who
escaped death, suffered mutilation, imprisonment,
or exile. Hundreds of the prisoners were
presented to the courtiers,—to be sold for ten
years as slaves in the West Indies. The twenty
young ladies of Taunton, who had figured in
the ovation to Monmouth, were assigned to the
Queen’s maids-of-honour, and they sold pardons
to the girls at the rate of a hundred pounds
a head!</p>

<p class='c006'>The accession of James brought no relaxation
in the oppressive laws bearing upon Scottish
presbyterianism. It was still in the power of the
military to apprehend and interrogate, to torture,
to confiscate the goods, and even to take the
lives of those suspected of nonconformity, or of
assisting outlawed persons. It was therefore to
be expected that any attempt to throw off the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>galling yoke would have general sympathy and
support. Argyle had himself been the victim of
unjust persecution; and yet his invasion of
Scotland was as futile and disastrous as that of
Monmouth was of England.</p>

<p class='c006'>Argyle was a Highland chief, influenced by his
old family feuds; and his foremost idea was to
fight the clans which were the hereditary enemies
of his house, and also loyal Jacobites. So with
about three hundred men he landed on the
western peninsula of Cantyre, and was joined by
about a thousand of his Campbell clansmen. He
proposed marching to Inverary; but the other
leaders were afraid of their little army being shut
up in the highlands, and thought that the western
shires—in which the covenanters were numerically
strong, and where they had already boldly faced
the government troops—would be a better field
for operations. There was as usual in such
differences, much wordy recrimination; time was
lost; and when at length a movement was made
into Lanarkshire, long, weary marches, with
mistakes in the route, disheartened and demoralized
the insurgents. The royal troops, in
superior numbers, were fast closing in on Argyle,
and, without a battle, his following fell to pieces,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>and himself was made prisoner. He was taken
with disgraceful indignities to Edinburgh, and his
old, most iniquitous sentence was carried out.
Like his father, he met his fate with firmness; he
said the grim instrument of death was “a sweet
Maiden, whose embrace would waft his soul into
heaven.” Upwards of twenty of the more considerable
of his followers also suffered death.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>EXECUTION OF THE EARL OF ARGYLE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As shewing the mean and cruel spirit of James,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>we may mention that on medals which he had
struck, commemorative of his triumphs over
Monmouth and Argyle, one side bore two
severed heads, and the reverse two headless
trunks.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now in his plenitude of power, James
began to shew openly what was his great
intention, namely, the subversion of the Protestant
faith, and the restitution of papal sway in Britain.
His brother had so far paved the way for such a
change, that he had taken advantage of the
reaction of loyalty at the Restoration, of the
general disgust at that detestable imposture, the
Titus Oates’ “popish plot,” and of the discovery
of the atrocious Rye House plot, to make his
government despotic. He had, by his foul
example, sown the seeds of immorality and
corruption broadcast through the national life.
Religious fervour and high political principle
seemed to have vanished from the land,—servile
submission to kingly authority was preached by
divines, sung by poets, and practised by statesmen,—as
the only safeguard against sombre
puritanism, political strife, and the misrule of the
mob.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now here was a zealot,—seeing sycophants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>all around him; men of position hasting to gain
his favour through the Romish confessional; a
servile parliament granting him bountiful supplies;
and a powerful French king sending him subsidies,—with
the property, the liberties, the very lives
of his subjects at his disposal,—can we wonder
that he thought that his authority could be
stretched to lording it also over their consciences?</p>

<p class='c006'>A century and a half previously, Henry VIII.
had abrogated the authority of the Pope in
England, and James may have believed that what
one despotic king could do, another could undo.
Of three things we hardly know which most to
wonder at:—the daring of the attempt—or, how
nearly he succeeded in his designs—or, that
amidst so much apathy, servility, and corruption,
he did not, for a time at least, accomplish his
ends. But the Reformation was, on the face of it,
a natural outcome of a new dawn, after the long
night of the dark ages in Europe. It was, with
the revival of letters, the new geographical
and scientific discoveries, and the general
spirit of adventure and research, a stepping-stone
towards progress and enlarged political
and intellectual freedom; whilst the proposed
retrocession to Rome meant going backwards,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>and a wilful surrender to the old bondage and
authority.</p>

<p class='c006'>James publicly attended the rites of his church;
he surrounded himself by Catholic priests, a
leading Jesuit, Father Petre, being his political
confidant; he entertained at his court—for the
first time in England since the days of Queen
Mary—a papal nuncio. He placed the Church
under the control of a High Commission of seven
members, Jeffreys, now Lord Chancellor, at the
head. In chartered towns, Catholics were to be
eligible to serve as mayors and aldermen. He
began the formation of a large standing army,
and, in defiance of the Test Act, and in assertion
of his dispensing power, he largely officered this
army by Catholics. The university of Oxford
had, in the previous reign, declared that in no
case was resistance to the royal authority justifiable,
and it had now to reap the bitter fruits of its
servile declaration. The King appointed a
Roman Catholic to the deanery of Christ Church;
another to the presidency of Magdalen College,
and twelve Catholic fellows were appointed in one
day. Oxford now began to see that passive
obedience might well stop short of a surrender
of religious principles; it resisted the royal mandates;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>and it would not submit, although twenty-five
of its fellows were expelled.</p>

<p class='c006'>And a contagion of conversion broke out in the
higher social ranks. Noble lords and ladies of
fashion went to mass and confession; processions
of Catholic priests were daily met in the streets of
London; Catholic chapels and monasteries were
becoming numerous, their service bells ringing
perpetually.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Scotland, the Chancellorship was bestowed
on one of the King’s time-serving converts,
Drummond, Earl of Perth. He co-operated
with the Earl of Sunderland in England, in
driving on James to the most extravagant reactionary
measures. By a new court order all
persons holding civil offices in Scotland were
ordered to resign, and to resume their offices
without taking the test oath, ordered in 1681,
they taking, for thus breaking the law, a remission
of penalties from the Crown; all not obtaining
such remission to be subjected to the said
penalties. That is,—all officials were ordered to
break the law, and were to be subject to penalties
for such infringement,—unless by getting the
King’s pardon they acknowledged his power to
abrogate the law! And this test oath had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>the contrivance of James himself when in
Scotland,—forced upon Presbyterians at the
sword’s point, and held so sacred that Argyle had
been condemned to death for taking it with a
slight qualification.</p>

<p class='c006'>The short reign of James was one of the
saddest periods in Scottish history. He had
refused to take the usual coronation oath, which
included the maintenance of the established
church. In spite of this refusal—which impaired
the validity of his right to rule—a weakly
compliant parliament expressed the loyalty of
absolute submission. The law against conventicles
was extended to the presence of five
persons, besides the family attending domestic
worship. If the meeting was held outside the
house—even on the door-step—it was to be
considered a field-conventicle punishable by
death. But on the question of repealing the
penal acts against Catholics, Parliament proved
refractory, and it was forthwith dissolved.</p>

<p class='c006'>The King issued a proclamation depriving the
burghs of the right of electing their own
magistrates. When, to favour Roman Catholicism,
he issued his Declaration of Indulgence, by which
there was to be general liberty of worship; yet—strange
anomaly—the laws against field-preaching
continued in full force. Under these
laws, James Renwick, a delicate, but enthusiastic
field-preacher, was executed in Edinburgh in
February, 1688. He was the last in the fearfully
long roll of covenanting martyrs.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>The Declaration of Indulgence, permitting all
professions of religion to worship in their own
ways, was published by James—solely on his own
authority—in April, 1687. At the first blush we
may be inclined to call this general indulgence a
step in the right direction,—even although we
know that under the cloak of toleration to all
forms of faith, the King’s main object was to
legalise Catholic worship and ritual. We now
say, from the more liberal stand-point of the
nineteenth century, that the penal laws against
the exercise of Catholic rites were tyrannical and
unjust. But we have to consider the times in
which these laws were introduced, when after a
long and bitter struggle the papal yoke had been
thrown off,—when the severities of Rome against
those she termed heretics were fresh in the
memory,—and that she never abates one jot of
her assumption to be the one authoritative church—claiming
the entire submission of Christendom.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>And Dissenters knew that the King was here
bidding for their support against the established
church. They saw that Tyrconnel, the King’s
Viceroy in Ireland—a country where James did
not require to keep up appearances—was fast
arming the Catholics, preparatory to a total
subversion of Protestantism; and thus the
Presbyterian and other dissenters saw in the
Episcopal Church the rallying point of religious
freedom; they overlooked its past subserviency
to power and its harshness to themselves, in
consideration of its present danger, and the stand
it was now preparing to make in the common
cause.</p>

<p class='c006'>In April, 1688, the king ordered his Declaration
to be read in all the churches. The London
clergy met and signed a refusal to comply with
the order, and the primate, Sancroft, and six
other bishops, presented a petition to the king
against being compelled to read a document
which assumed the legality of the dispensing
power. Only in seven of the London churches,
and a few in the country, was the Declaration
read. The king was furious, and summoned
the bishops before the privy council; on their
acknowledging their signatures to the petition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>they were committed to the Tower. Their
passage down the Thames was a public ovation;
from crowded quays, bridges, and barges arose
enthusiastic shouts of encouragement; the very
officers of the Tower went on their knees for the
episcopal blessing. In their imprisonment, the
bishops were visited daily by nobles and leading
men; and—which irritated James most of all—a
deputation of dissenting ministers went and
thanked them in the name of their common
Protestantism.</p>

<p class='c006'>And just at this time an event occurred which
had a remarkable bearing on the history of the
period. On June 10th, 1688, James’s queen
gave birth to a son. The news had been
circulated that a child was expected; the faithful
ventured to prophesy a prince; a blessing
vouchsafed by the intervention of the Virgin
Mary, in response to prayers and pilgrimages.
But Protestant England had both feared and
doubted. The Court and its household were,
almost exclusively, composed of Catholics, and
when the birth of a prince was announced, it was
generally believed that a strange child had been
smuggled into the palace, and was then being
passed off as the king’s son. There now seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>little doubt but that the infant was really the
offspring of the king and queen. Thus, to his
father’s joy, and to Catholic anticipations of the
throne being after him still occupied by a king of
the old faith—but with general doubts and
misgivings—with repudiation instead of welcome,
came into the world the ill-fated prince, known in
our history as James the Pretender.</p>

<p class='c006'>On June 20th, the trial of the bishops took
place before the Court of King’s Bench. They
were charged with having “published a false,
malicious, and seditious libel.” Of the four
judges, two were for the petition being a libel,
and two were against. The jury had to decide
the question, and were locked up during the
night. At ten o’clock next morning, when the
Court again met, there was a silence of deep
suspense before the verdict was pronounced.
When the words “not guilty” fell from the
foreman’s lips, a great cheer arose, which
penetrated into the crowded street, and was
speedily wafted over London, extending even to
the troops on parade at Blackheath. It was a
day of general congratulation and rejoicing; and
bonfires and illuminations went far into the

  <h2 id='ch22' class='c004'>The Revolution of 1688.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>Before the birth of the prince, the general
idea had been that the country should tide
over James’s misgovernment as best it could, and
wait patiently for the succession to the throne in
natural course of Mary, Princess of Orange, the
elder daughter of the king by his first marriage.
But the situation was now altogether changed;
and on the very day of the acquittal of the
bishops, there was sent—signed by the bishop of
London, several noblemen, and others—an
invitation to William to come over with an army
to the relief of the country: and the prince at
once commenced his preparations.</p>

<p class='c006'>And meantime, James, his purposes and hopes
of success strengthened by the birth of a son,
was indignant at his defeat in the trial of the
bishops, and, goaded on by the French minister
and his inner circle of advisers, he resolved to
crush the spirit of the nation by force of arms.
He brought over several regiments of Tyrconnel’s
Irish troops, and their menacing presence, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>strangers and Catholics, was hateful to the
English people. A derisive doggrel ballad, called
from its burden <cite>Lilliburelo</cite>, was sung and
whistled all over the land.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now the king was told that his Dutch
son-in-law was making great preparations for
invasion. He knew that he had lost the best
safeguard of his throne—the confidence and
affection of his subjects—and whilst adopting
means for defence, he hastened to retract all the
measures which had made him unpopular. He
threw himself in feigned repentance on the
advice of the bishops, and they, in plain words, like
the prophets of old, told him of his injustice and
oppression, and advised him at once to call a
Parliament. He dismissed his priestly adviser
Father Petre, and the renegade Lord Sunderland.
He restored its fellows to Oxford, and their
franchises to the corporations. But the precipitation
of fear was so evident in his concessions,
that there was no reaction of confidence. The
people were watching the weathercocks, and
praying for a north-east, or, as it was called “a
Protestant” wind.</p>

<p class='c006'>After waiting some weeks for a favourable
wind, and with an after-delay from storms, by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>end of October, William was fairly at sea. He
first sailed up the North Sea, as if he intended a
landing on the Yorkshire coast; but changed his
course for the Channel. The wind and tide
prevented the royal fleet from attacking him in
the Straits of Dover. From the opposite coasts
his fleet presented a magnificent sight. There
were sixty men-of-war and seven hundred
transports, extending twenty miles in length.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was just a hundred years since such another
magnificent spectacle had been seen in the
Channel—the Spanish Armada—also bent upon
the invasion of England. <em>Then</em>, the great fleet
meant papal aggression, and priestly domination;
<em>now</em>, it meant deliverance from this aggression,
and freedom of the conscience; <em>then</em>, beacon
fires on mount and headland flashed danger to
the lives and liberties of Englishmen; <em>now</em> the
tidings that a foreign fleet was skirting the coast
were of glad and hopeful assurance.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 5th of November—the anniversary of
the Gunpowder Plot—the fleet anchored at
Torbay, in Devonshire. With his army of fifteen
thousand men, William marched to Exeter,
where he was enthusiastically received. But the
memory of Jeffreys’ “bloody assize” was still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>fresh in the western shires, and for several days
there were few signs of encouragement; it is said
that he even meditated returning to Holland.
But bye-and-bye one nobleman after another, and
several officers of James’s army, entered the camp.
The north of England began to stir in raising
and disciplining revolutionary troops, and the
Earl of Bath put Plymouth into William’s hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>The King hastened down to Salisbury, resolved
to stake his kingdom on the issue of a battle; but
William, although a thorough captain in war,
wished to avoid bloodshed; he trusted to the
increasing stream of desertion from the king
rendering a great battle unnecessary. And so it
turned out. The sagacious lieutenant-general of
the king’s army, Lord Churchill, the Dukes of
Grafton and Ormond, even the king’s younger
daughter Anne, with her husband, Prince George
of Denmark, and many other persons of note,
joined the Prince of Orange.</p>

<p class='c006'>James went back to London, and sent away the
queen and her five-months’ old child to France.
When he knew of their safety he left London at
night, by the river. He threw the great seal into
the Thames, and proceeded to Sheerness, where
a small vessel was waiting for him. Boarding the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>vessel he attracted the attention of some Kentish
fishermen, who, in hopes of reward, made him
prisoner. Released, by an order of the Lords,
he returned to London, and passed thence to
Rochester. William wanted him out of the
country; so facilities were made for his escape,
and he was soon at St. Germains, where Louis
gave him a friendly reception; and at St.
Germains he made his home. Assisted by Louis,
he made, next year, an attempt for the recovery
of Ireland. In that essentially Catholic country,
it seemed at first that he would there be able to
retain one of the three kingdoms, but his defeat
by William, at the Boyne, compelled his return to
France. He died September 16th, 1701, aged
68 years.</p>

<p class='c006'>The King, having fled, and no parliament
sitting, William was advised to claim the kingdom
by right of conquest. But both from principle
and sound policy he held that this would be a less
secure right of possession than would be the
choice—as formal as under the circumstances it
could be made—of the English people. So he
summoned a Convention of the States of the
Realm,—irregularly convoked in the emergency,
but elected in the usual manner. The Convention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>met on 22nd February—six weeks after the
King’s flight.</p>

<p class='c006'>The debates were long and stormy; the two
Houses disagreed,—the Lords could hardly bring
themselves to declare for the deposition of the
King; but the Commons were firm, and at length
this resolution was passed in both houses: “That
James, having violated the fundamental laws, and
withdrawn himself from the kingdom, has broken
the original contract between king and people,
has abdicated the government, and therefore the
throne has become vacant.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And then came the questions,—Who was to
reign? and what was to be the order of
succession? Here there was a division of opinion.
Was James’s infant son to be acknowledged as
King—with William as Regent? or, Should the
crown be conferred on Mary in her own right?
William was not a man of many words, but he
now got together a few of the leading men, and
to them he spoke very plainly: he would not
interfere with the right of the Convention to settle
its own affairs as it thought best; but for himself
he would not accept any regency, nor—much as
he loved his wife—would he remain in England
as her gentleman-usher. In a few hours his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>words were all over London, and it was known
that he would be King.</p>

<p class='c006'>So the Convention passed a number of
resolutions, embodied in what was termed a
Declaration of Rights,—defining the royal
prerogative, and the powers of parliament; and
the Prince and Princess, having signified their
adhesion thereto, it was resolved that William
and Mary be jointly King and Queen of England,
Ireland, and the dominions belonging thereto;
the administration to rest in William. The crown
was settled,—first on the survivor of the royal
pair,—then on the children of Mary, then on
those of her sister Anne, and next on the children
of William by any other wife. The son of James
and his posterity were thus shut out entirely from
the succession.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Scottish Convention of Estates passed
resolutions nearly similar to those in the English
Declaration of Rights, closing with a declaration
against Prelacy, asserting that there was no
higher office in the Church than presbyter.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the leading question then before the
country, their resolution had a more decided tone
than that of the English Convention. They
declared that James had assumed the throne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>without taking the oaths prescribed by law, that
he had proceeded to subvert the constitution of
the country from a limited monarchy to an
absolute despotism; that he had employed the
powers thus usurped for violating the laws and
liberties, and altering the religion of Scotland;
for doing these things he had <em>forfeited</em> his right
to the crown, and the throne had thereby become
vacant. The Scottish royalty was conferred on
William and Mary, in like terms as that of the
English Convention.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Battle of Killiecrankie.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>In the crisis of his affairs, James had
summoned his Scottish troops to England.
Their commander, Lord Douglas, went over to
William; but the second in command, John
Graham of Claverhouse—now Viscount Dundee—had
an interview with the King—assured him
of the loyalty of his troops, about 6,500 well
disciplined men, advised the King either to
hazard a battle, or to fall back with these troops
into Scotland. On the King declining both
propositions, Lord Dundee took up a position at
Watford, about eighteen miles north-west of
London, expecting an attack by William. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>Dundee had served his early campaigns under
the Prince, having in one engagement rescued
him from imminent danger. So the Prince now
sent him a message that he had no quarrel with
him. Then came James’s flight, and the Prince’s
entry into London; and Dundee seeing he could
do nothing more to help James in England, rode
back with about twenty-five of his dragoons into
Scotland. The Scottish army was placed under
General Mackay, one of William’s adherents, and
he was shortly after sent as commander of the
royal forces into Scotland.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lord Dundee came to Edinburgh, for some
time hovering like a hawk over the then sitting
Convention. The Duke of Gordon still held the
Castle for King James; Dundee had an interview
with the Duke and advised “no surrender,”
he then, with a few horsemen, left the city. (We
all know the ringing song in which Sir Walter
Scott narrates his departure.) Like a fiery-cross
he went through the highlands, rousing the
clansman to battle for the fallen Stuart King.
The man must have had a dominating personality;
in a short time he had assembled an army, feeble in
discipline and cohesion no doubt; but, as it proved,
good for the kind of work it befell them to do.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>The highlanders were posted on an open slope
at the head of the pass of Killiecrankie in the
north Perthshire hills. To give them battle,
Mackay, on 17th June, 1689, advanced up the
pass. When the royal troops entered the defile,
no enemy was to be seen,—only the pines
towering high upon the cliffs on either hand, and
the river Garry rushing swiftly by the narrow
pathway through the pass. To the Lowland and
Dutch soldiers, who composed the royal army, it
was a scene novel and magnificent, but bewildering,
awe-inspiring.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dundee allowed the whole of Mackay’s army
to emerge from the pass, and even to form in
order of battle, before he began the attack. It
was an hour before sunset that the highlanders
advanced. They fired their muskets only once,
and throwing them away, with fierce shouts they
rushed down with broadsword and target.
Mackay’s line was broken by the onset. When
it came to disordered ranks, and the clash of hand
to hand combats, the superior discipline of the
royal troops was of no account. Agility, hardihood,
and the confidence of assured victory were
on the side of the clansmen. It was soon a rout;
but with such a narrow gorge for retreat it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>became a massacre. Two thousand of Mackay’s
troops were slain. The highlanders’ loss was
eight hundred; but amongst these was their
gallant leader. Near the end of the battle,
Dundee, on horseback, was extending his right
arm to the clan Macdonald, as directing their
movements, when he was struck by a bullet
under the arm-pit, where he was unprotected by
his cuirass. With him perished the cause of
King James in Scotland. After his death his
army melted away, and both highlands and
lowlands submitted to the Government of
William.</p>

<p class='c006'>General lenity and toleration were the watchwords
of William’s policy. The episcopal church
was to be maintained in England, and the
presbyterian in Scotland; but neither were to
ride rough-shod over dissenters. In Scotland,
much against the desires of the more rigid, as
the Cameronians, there were to be no reprisals
for former persecution and oppression. Even
obnoxious officials were maintained in their old
places. When the Jacobite rising in Ireland was
quelled by the surrender of Limerick, a treaty
was there made by which Catholics were to be
allowed the free exercise of their religion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>William endeavoured to get parliament to ratify
this treaty, but two months after it had been
entered into, the English Parliament imposed a
declaration against Transubstantiation on
members of the Irish parliament, and this
parliament, entirely composed of Protestants,
whilst giving nominal confirmation, really put the
Catholics in a worse condition than they were
before. The Irish Catholics have since then
called Limerick, “the town of the broken
treaty.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch23' class='c004'>The Massacre of Glencoe.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>To counteract the spirit of disloyalty which
was still lurking amongst the Highland
clans, the Earl of Breadalbane, cousin to the
Duke of Argyle, was entrusted with £16,000, to
be distributed among the various chieftains,
conditionally on their making submission to
William and Mary. The Earl did not make an
impartial distribution of the money; the leading
chiefs were bought off, the lesser were intimidated
by threats. A branch of the clan MacDonald
were settled in a wild valley, Glencoe, in north
Argyleshire; a small river, the Coe (the Cona of
Ossian—a name which sounds musically sweet—calling
up thoughts of serenity and peace,) runs
through the valley towards Lochleven—the arm
of the sea which separates Argyleshire from
Inverness-shire. The valley spreads flatwise to the
bases of the surrounding hills, which seem to
stand as fortressed walls to guard it from all
danger. But in this secluded spot—shut off as it
seemed from the outer world—was enacted the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>basest of all the acts of treachery and barbarity
which disgrace this seventeenth century.</p>

<p class='c006'>MacIan, the chief of the MacDonalds of
Glencoe, was an old man, stately, venerable,
sagacious. He now charged Breadalbane with
having defrauded him of his share of the government
money; the earl retorted that MacIan and
his tribe had been persistent marauders over his
Campbell clansmen’s lands round Glencoe, which
was probably true enough, as there had been a
feud of long standing between the clans. A
proclamation had been issued that—under severe
penalties for non-compliance—submission had to
be made before the 1st of January, 1692; MacIan,
out of a spirit of contrariness, put off taking the
oath, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, the
Master of Stair, a friend of Breadalbane’s,
reported officially to the government that the
MacDonalds were not making submission, and
that they were an incorrigibly lawless tribe of
thieves and murderers.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 31st of December, MacIan and several
of his leading clansmen went to Fort-William,
and proffered to take the oath of allegiance
before Colonel Hill, the commanding officer.
Not being a civil official, the Colonel was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>empowered to administer the oath, but, moved by
the distress of the old man, who saw the danger
to which his obstinacy had exposed his people, he
gave him a letter to Sir Colin Campbell, the
Sheriff of Argyleshire, requesting him to receive,
although after the official date, the submission of
the chief. With this letter MacIan hastened on,
through snowstorms, by swollen streams, and
rugged mountain paths, to Inverary. The road
passed near his own home, but he was now in
such haste that he went right on; but it was the
6th of January, before he had accomplished the
weary fifty miles, and presented himself before the
sheriff. The sheriff, considering all the circumstances,
administered the oath; he gave MacIan
a certificate, and wrote to the Privy Council,
detailing the facts, and giving explanatory reasons
for his own conduct in the matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the secretary had hoped to have had
MacIan in his power, and was chagrined by the
submission; so the sheriff’s letter was suppressed,
and the submission deleted from the records of
the council. On the 16th of January, the
secretary obtained the king’s signature to the
following order, addressed to the commander of
the forces in Scotland:—“As for MacIan of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Glencoe, and that tribe, if they can be well
distinguished from the rest of the Highlanders, it
will be proper for the vindication of public justice
to extirpate that set of thieves.” Burnet says
that William did not read the order, but signed it,
thinking it was only a detail in ordinary business.
Another explanation is, that the fact of MacIan’s
submission being treacherously withheld from
William, he thought that the extirpation meant by
the order was, that <em>as</em> a “set of thieves” they
were to be broken up, and brought under ordinary
law. William could not have meant to order or
to sanction the horrible event which followed;
but still the name of Glencoe ever sounds as a
blast of judgment against the fair fame of the
Deliverer.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now, as under the royal order, the
secretary gave explicit instructions for the
indiscriminate butchery of the whole “damnable
race.” The passes were to be guarded to prevent
any escape. “In the winter,” he wrote, “they
cannot carry their wives, children, and cattle to
the mountains. This is the proper season to
maul them, in the long dark nights.” A detachment
of troops, belonging Argyle’s regiment,
under Campbell of Glenlyon, were sent into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>glen. They were hospitably received, and were
quartered amongst the inhabitants. A niece of
Glenlyon’s was married to a son of MacIan’s, and
for twelve days there was hunting by day, and
feasting, card-playing, and healths-drinking in the
long evenings. Glenlyon and a party accepted
an invitation to dine with MacIan on the 13th of
February, but, as had been previously arranged,
at four o’clock of the morning of that day, the
work of blood began. The old chief was shot in
his bed; his wife was stripped naked, and died
next day from terror and exposure. The two
sons of MacIan were aroused by the musket
shots, the shouts of the murderers, and the
screams of the victims; they, with many others,
men, women, and children, fled, half-naked, in
darkness, snow, and storm, into the less savage
wilderness. The falling snow proved fatal to
several of the fugitives, but it was the salvation of
the others, for it prevented the troops, who were
to have guarded the passes, from arriving at the
time appointed, to intercept and slay all who had
escaped from death in the glen. It was mid-day
when these troops, by the several passes entered
the glen, and they found no MacDonald alive
but an old man of eighty, and him they slew.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Every hut was burned, the cattle and horses of
the tribe were collected, and driven to the
garrison of Fort-William.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thirty-eight victims: Was Secretary Stair
satisfied? Not he; he was mortified that his
plans for total destruction had failed. “I regret,”
he wrote, “that any got away.” It is said that
two men—one engaged in the contrivance of the
massacre, and the other in its execution—Breadalbane
and Glenlyon—did feel the stings of
conscience, the heart-gnawings of remorse, and
were never the same men afterwards.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was long before the hideous story of Glencoe
came to be generally known. On the facts being
published, there rose a popular clamour for an
inquiry. On the eve of the meeting of the
Scottish Parliament, in 1695, it was known to
ministers that the war-cry would be “Glencoe.”
So in haste they got the King to appoint a
Commission. After a searching enquiry, the
Commission reported that the slaughter at Glencoe
was murder; and that of this murder the letters
of the Master of Stair were the sole warrant and
cause. As a punishment for his great crime,
Stair was <em>dismissed from office</em>!</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c004'>The Union of Scotland and England.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>Just at the time when the full realization of
the horrors of Glencoe was agitating the
public mind, the disastrous Darien scheme was
floated. This, the first great national adventure
in foreign commerce, was a wild speculation,
based upon the fanciful assumptions of one man,
William Paterson. His scheme was to establish
a trading colony on the narrow isthmus joining
North and South America, as a convenient stage
between India and Europe. His eloquent tongue,
and even more eloquent reservations, produced
glowing visions of national and individual wealth.
There was a rush for shares in the “Company
of Scotland;” for their purchase landowners
mortgaged their estates, farmers sold their cattle,
widows pledged their jointures. Nearly half-a-million
sterling was subscribed. Ships and
stores were purchased, and in July, 1698, a
colonizing expedition of 1200 men left Leith,
amidst the wildest popular enthusiasm. It
reached its destination, and under the ninth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>parallel of north latitude a New Edinburgh was
founded.</p>

<p class='c006'>The enterprise was an utter failure; the climate
was found to be a deadly one, and famine was
imminent; many died, and there was general
sickness and debility. Under instructions from
the home government, the governors of English
West India settlements issued proclamations,
denouncing the Scottish colonists as pirates, and
interdicting supplies and communications. The
Spaniards, claiming the land as theirs, were fitting
out hostile armaments. Finding that to remain
meant nothing short of extermination, all who
were left took to their ships; drifting almost at the
mercy of winds and waves, they arrived at the
Hudson river. A second expedition of 1300 men
landed to find ruins and a solitude, and to meet a
similar fate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Glencoe had largely weakened the popularity of
William in Scotland, and his hostile action towards
the Darien scheme excited hatred and disloyalty.
Jacobitism, instead of wearing itself out, became
more deeply rooted and more formidable. The
golden link of the crown, which during the
seventeenth century had been the only official tie
between the two nations, seemed a fragile one;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>and the King saw, with the prescience of a
statesman, that there must either be closer union,
or entire separation. He could see that—comparatively
weak as Scotland was—its influence
might, under a foreign complication, have to be
deducted from the strength of England.</p>

<p class='c006'>In February, 1702, William met with the
accident—a fall from his horse—which resulted in
his death. When he knew that his end was
approaching he sent his last message under his
sign-manual to Parliament, recommending the
union of the kingdoms; it would be a comfort to
him if Parliament would favourably consider the
matter. The Commons agreed to consider the
King’s message on the 7th of March—on that day
he was in <i>extremis</i>—dying in the night.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Anne, William’s sister-in-law, reigned.
The Scots were still irritable over the English
treatment of the Darien scheme, and their
Parliament passed what was called <i>The Act of
Security</i>. By this act it was ordained that the
English successor to the then reigning sovereign,
would not be adopted by Scotland, unless there
was free trade between the two countries, and the
internal affairs of Scotland thoroughly secured
from English influence. The Queen’s High
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Commissioner refused the royal assent to this
defiant measure, and the English House of Peers
passed a resolution, that a dangerous plot existed
in Scotland for the overthrow of the Protestant
succession in that nation. The Scots highly
resented this resolution, declaring it to be an
unauthorised interference with the concerns of an
independent kingdom. The Estates refused to
grant supplies, and ordered the disciplining, by
monthly drills, of all men capable of bearing arms.
The reply of the English Parliament was, by the
enactment of fresh restrictions upon Scottish trade
with England and its colonies, and by ordering
the border towns of Newcastle, Berwick, and
Carlisle to be fortified and garrisoned.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the queen had in her minister, Earl
Godolphin, a wise and sagacious statesman; by
his advice she gave in 1704, her assent to the Act
of Security. And the English Parliament empowered
the queen to nominate commissioners to
discuss with commissioners appointed by the
Scottish estates terms of a treaty of union
between the two nations. Thirty commissioners
were thus appointed on each side; ostensibly they
represented all parties; but Godolphin’s powerful
influence was so exerted in the selection, that not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>only was there a majority on both sides in favour
of union, but also for that union being favourable
to England. There is more than mere suspicion
that English money was freely given, and English
promises of personal advancement were largely
made, to induce the Scottish Commissioners to
agree to terms which were certainly unjust to
Scotland.</p>

<p class='c006'>The numerical proportion of its population,
entitled Scotland to send sixty-six members to a
united House of Commons; but the number was
restricted to forty-five. Of the Scottish nobility,
not one was to be entitled by right of title or of
possessions, to sit in the House of Lords; but
there were to be sixteen representative peers.
For the English bishops holding seats in the
upper house, there was to be no Scottish
counterpart. The Scottish nobles on the Commission
were tempted to agree to the ignominious
position their order was to be placed in by the
promise that themselves would be created <i>British
peers</i>, with hereditary seats in the Lords.
Scotland was to pay a fair proportion of the
general taxation. She was to retain her Presbyterian
Church, and her own civil and municipal
laws and institutions.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>When the articles of the proposed treaty as
arranged by the joint Commission were published,
there was in Scotland a general outburst of rage
and mortification. It seemed as if they were to
make a voluntary surrender of their dearly bought
independence,—a descent from their position as a
free nation, into that of a mere province. When
the Scottish Parliament met in October, 1706, the
whole country was in a state of dangerous
excitement. Addresses against the proposed terms
of union were sent from every county and town,
from almost every parish in the kingdom. In
some towns, copies of the Articles of Union were
publicly burned. Edinburgh was in a state of
wild tumult; the High Commissioner was hooted;
the Provost, who was known to favour the
obnoxious treaty, had his house wrecked. In the
House of Parliament there were fierce debates,
“resembling,” said an eye witness, “not a mere
strife of tongues, but the clash of arms.” The
opposition, headed by the Duke of Hamilton, did
all they could to hinder the measure; finding
their resistance ineffectual, they retired from the
parliament house, and, clause by clause, the
articles of treaty were formally passed by the
compliant majority.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>In March, 1707, the English parliament ratified
the Treaty of Union, and on the 1st of May
ensuing, it came into operation. It had been
carried through the Scottish Parliament by
transparent venality, and under popular disfavour.
It was inaugurated in Scotland with sullen
discontent, and for six years it was there the
ruling passion to discredit and decry it. And so
far its results had not contradicted evil forebodings.
As had been feared, the very slender
representation of Scotland in the Imperial
Parliament, gave it only a weak voice in legislature.
The English treason laws, and malt-tax
were extended to Scotland. The Scottish
representatives in the Commons complained that
they were not treated as equals by their fellow-members—not
as representing a free nation, the
equal of England in its rights and privileges,
but a subjugated and dependent province.
Sneers at their country, and sarcasms on their
own accent, manners, and appearance, were daily
met with by men who were proud of their native
land, and in that land had been accorded the
respect due to gentlemen of birth, breeding, and
education. And Scottish noblemen, who had
not been elected on the representative sixteen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>but had been created <i>British Peers</i> by the
sovereign, were, by a resolution of the House of
Lords, refused seats in that House.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1713, the Scottish members in both Houses,—and
who included within their ranks men of all
political parties—Revolution Whigs, and Tory
advocates of kingly prerogative, Jacobites and
adherents of the House of Hanover,—unanimously
resolved to move in parliament the repeal of
the Act of Union, on the grounds that it had
failed in the good results which had been
anticipated from it. And in the then state of
parties in England, there seemed a fair chance of
carrying the proposed abrogation. For the
Whigs, who had been the dominant party, from
the Revolution to 1710, when they were ousted
from office, were now—although they had been
the active promoters of the Union—prepared to
do anything to cripple the government. The
defence of the Union now rested with the Tories,
who had strenuously opposed it, and obstructed it
at every stage.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 1st of June, the motion for repeal was
brought up in the House of Lords, and after a
warm debate was rejected by a majority of only
four votes. So, happily for both countries, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Union had farther trial; and as in the generality
of prognostications of evil, as the resultant of
political or social change, time has proved their
falsity. Under the Union, Scotland advanced in
material prosperity, and as a nation she has fully
maintained her national prestige. Scotsmen have
ever taken an active part—at times a leading
part—in imperial affairs. In diplomacy and in
war, in science and invention, in literature and art,
in philosophy and trading enterprise, Scotsmen
have been well in line with men of the other
nationalities which together constitute the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.</p>

  <h2 id='ch25' class='c004'>The Jacobite Risings of 1715.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>Queen Anne was not a woman of strong
intellect, but simple and homely in her
tastes; weakly obstinate, like the Stuart race.
In the earlier years of her reign, with the Whigs
in power, she was under the stronger will of
Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough; in the later
years, when the Tories held office, she was largely
ruled by a Mrs. Masham. Her domestic story
was a painful one. She passed through a
motherhood of nineteen children, nearly all of
whom died in infancy, only one son reaching the
age of eleven years. Her husband, Prince George
of Denmark, was the very embodiment of dulness
and stupidity. King James, his father-in-law,
said of him, “I have tried George drunk, and I
have tried him sober; drunk or sober there is
nothing in him.” He took no part in public
affairs. He died in 1708, and Anne, widowed,
childless, and in broken health, was as lonely a
woman as any within the three kingdoms which
acknowledged her sovereignty.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>There is no doubt that after she had lost all
her own children, her sympathies were with her
father’s son, generally known as <i>The Pretender</i>.
She felt more and more as her life was ebbing to
its end, that she had not been a dutiful daughter.
In her own loneliness she must have had abiding
thoughts of her young brother, expatriated from
his father-land. Whilst she was living in royal
estate, he, the legitimate heir of that estate, was a
homeless waif,—ever tantalized by fruitless hopes
and longings. What to her was this second
cousin in Hanover,—a foreigner by birth and in
all his interests? She was horror-stricken at, and
absolutely refused to sanction, a Whig proposal,
that Elector George should be invited to visit
Britain, and make some acquaintance with the
country which he was one day to rule over.</p>

<p class='c006'>Anne’s two leading ministers—Oxford and
Bolingbroke, at one in their Jacobite proclivities,
were yet at personal variance. At a council
meeting, on 27th July, 1714, at which the queen
was present, they had a fierce quarrel, and, under
the joint influence of Bolingbroke and Mrs.
Masham, the Queen dismissed Oxford from office.
But the triumph of Bolingbroke was short-lived,
for the stormy council meeting so acted on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>queen, that she next day fell into a lethargy, from
which—with brief intervals of semi-consciousness—she
never rallied.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 30th of July, when it was known that
the queen was sinking, two Whig lords, the
Dukes of Somerset and Argyle, took upon
themselves, in virtue of their position as privy-councillors,
to attend unsummoned the council
board. They found the ministers in a state of
utter perplexity and alarm; humble enough to
agree to a proposal that in the present grave
crisis, the queen should be asked to confer the
premiership upon the Duke of Shrewsbury. He
had taken a leading part in the revolution, been
one of William’s chief secretaries of state, and was
much respected by both parties. The dying
queen gave, by a sign, her consent to his receiving
the staff of office. That feeble sign was the last
public action of the Stuart dynasty. Anne died
on the 1st of August, and next day the Elector of
Hanover,—through his mother and grandmother,
a great grandson of James I.,—was, as George the
First, proclaimed king in London.</p>

<p class='c006'>The new king, knowing that the Whigs were
his best friends, formed his ministry from their
ranks. Three of Anne’s ministers, Oxford,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>Bolingbroke, and the Duke of Ormond, were
impeached for high treason; Oxford was sent to
the Tower; Bolingbroke and Ormond escaped to
the Continent, where they joined the councils of
the Pretender. The Tory party, although out of
official power, comprised the bulk of the landowners,
the clergy, and the learning of England;
and the popular mind—as shewn in tumultuous
crowds, cheering Jacobite speeches, and burning
effigies of King William—was largely reactionary.</p>

<p class='c006'>As tidings of British agitation and discontent
were wafted across the Channel, so rose the hopes
of the Pretender and his little court of adherents
at St. Germains. Vessels were equipped at
Havre and Dieppe, with arms and ammunition.
The Pretender’s plan of operations turned upon
the Duke of Ormond making a landing in
England, and the Duke of Berwick in Scotland.
The latter, a natural son of James II., by a
sister of the Duke of Marlborough, had a high
military reputation, and if he had had the general
direction of the movement, the results might have
been different. But on the 6th of September,
1715, the Earl of Mar, without any commission
from the Pretender, set up his standard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>at Braemar, and proclaimed him King of
Scotland.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mar had got up Highland games and hunting
expeditions, and being an eloquent speaker, he
inflamed the minds of the chieftains with sanguine
hopes of a successful issue to a general rising.
Ten thousand men rallied round the flag of
rebellion. And in Northumberland, under the
Earl of Derwentwater, and Mr. Foster, a county
member of Parliament, there was a simultaneous
rising. Mar sent a thousand Highlandmen in
aid; on their way they were joined by several
noblemen and gentlemen of the south of Scotland.
The little Northumbrian army marched into
Lancashire, and occupied Preston; attacked there
by royal troops, they, after an obstinate defence,
surrendered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile, Mar, after occupying Perth, marched
to join the English insurgents. At Sheriffmuir,
near Dunblane, he was met by a royalist force
under the Duke of Argyle, and on the same day
as the surrender at Preston, a battle was fought.
The left wing of both armies defeated its
opponents; so it was technically a drawn battle.
But it was tantamount to a rebel defeat; next
morning Argyle occupied the field of action; Mar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>had retired to Perth. On December 22nd, the
Pretender arrived in a small vessel at Peterhead.
He made a quasi-royal progress to Perth, having
himself proclaimed as James the Eighth in all
the towns he passed through. Of a handsome
person, he could be courteous in his manners;
but he lacked animation; his general expression
was sombre and uninviting, not one to raise
enthusiasm in men engaged in a desperate
enterprise. He entered Perth on 9th January,
1716, taking up his quarters at Scone, and giving
instructions for his coronation.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the dream of the crown, which had
tantalized the prince from boyhood, vanished into
thin air before the stern realities around him.
Mar’s army was dispirited by inaction, and
melting away by desertions. Argyle had been
reinforced by English troops and Dutch auxiliaries,
and had had a field-train from Berwick. On
January 30th, he was in sight of Perth. The
prospect of a battle raised the spirits of the
clansmen, but the leaders had seen for weeks that
their enterprise was hopeless, and Mar ordered a
retreat. It had been an especially cold winter,
the Tay, instead of being a strongly flowing
river, was then a frozen highway, and in sullen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>discontent, the clans crossed over and began their
retreat. They marched in good order, unmolested
by Argyle. In four days they had reached
Montrose, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>en route</i></span> for Aberdeen; there, it was
promised them they would meet a large body of
French troops, and again, with bright hopes of
success, march southwards.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>JAMES FRANCIS, THE OLD PRETENDER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On February 4th, the retreat was to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>continued; the carriage and mounted guards of
the prince were waiting before the gateway of his
lodgings, but no prince appeared. He had slunk
off by a back-way and, with the Earl of Mar, Lord
Drummond, and the <i>gentlemen</i> of his suite, gone
on board a small vessel in the harbour, lying ready
for their reception. It was, perhaps, the meanest
desertion by the leaders of a warlike enterprise in
all history. The prince left a sealed letter, to be
opened in Aberdeen. Its contents were found to
be formal thanks for faithful services, <i>permission</i>
to choose between dispersion, and as a body
coming to terms with the enemy; and apprizing
the men that their pay had now ceased. There
was an outburst of rage and mortification, and then
the clans, under great privations, sought their
native glens and villages; the leaders tried to
make their escape to the continent from the
northern sea-ports.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the twelve years of Anne’s reign there
was not a single execution for treason, but now
the headsman and hangman were again at work.
Of those who took part in the English insurrection,
the Earl of Derwentwater, Lord Kenmore, and
about twenty other persons were executed.
Foster and several others made rather marvellous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>escapes from prison. In Scotland about forty
families of note lost their estates. But a trick of
the government, in ordering that the commission
for the trial of the Scottish rebels should sit in
Carlisle, raised such a cry of injustice, and of
being an infringement of the Articles of Union,
that the accused were given to understand that if
they did not challenge the authority of the Court,
they would be mercifully dealt with. The result
was, that although twenty-four were condemned,
not one of them was executed.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the native efforts of Jacobitism in 1715
had resulted in utter failure, it had certain
glimmerings of success through foreign complications.
King George never became in heart,
in habits, or in policy, an Englishman. In his
Hanoverian policy he embroiled Britain with
Sweden and Spain. He purchased from the
King of Denmark the duchies of Bremen and
Verden, which duchies the King of Sweden—the
redoubtable Charles XII.—claimed as his own.
Charles now proposed to place himself at the head
of a confederacy, to dethrone King George, and
put the Pretender in his place. His idea was, to
land with 10,000 men in the north of Scotland, to
call upon the highland clans to again rally round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>a Jacobite standard, and, with the co-operation of
a Spanish fleet, to march into England. It is
one of the might-have-beens with which history
abounds. But a cannon shot at the siege of
Frederickshall, in 1718, ended the erratic course
of Charles.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next year the Pretender was received with
royal honours at Madrid, and an expedition of ten
ships of war, with 6,000 troops and much warlike
stores on board, was placed under the command
of the Duke of Ormond, and sailed for Scotland.
A violent storm off Cape Finisterre scattered the
expedition. Two frigates landed 300 men at
Lewis; these surrendered to the royal troops sent
against them. This same year the Pretender
married a Polish princess; by her he had two
sons,—Charles Edward, and Henry Benedict.</p>

  <h2 id='ch26' class='c004'>The Rebellion of 1745.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>In 1724, the government sent Marshal Wade
into the Highlands to take measures to
enforce law and order, and to facilitate military
communication. Wade was a man of good
common sense, and he did his work with tact and
judgment. The clansmen were disarmed; but
commissions were given to loyal chieftains to
raise militia companies, to be disciplined and
trained in the use of arms. Some of these
companies, as the celebrated <i>Black Watch</i>, which
became the 42nd regiment, were composed of
men in good social positions, as farmers, tacksmen,
and sons of highland gentlemen. And Wade
employed his soldiers to construct, under skilful
supervision, well-formed roads, connected together,
and more direct. A memorable distich was
posted up near Fort-William:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Had you seen those roads before they were made,</div>
      <div class='line'>You would hold up your hands and bless General Wade.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On the surface the Highlands were quiet, and
were being brought more and more within the pale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>of British citizenship. Sheriffs held their courts in
all the northern shires; schools were established
in every parish; farmers and breeders had better
access to fairs and markets, and hillside cottars to
their Kirks. But the embers of Jacobitism still
smouldered; the chiefs had no liking for these
German Georges, and the clansmen would still
follow their chieftain’s leadership.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there was no special agitation or disquietude
in the Highlands when, on the 25th of July,
1745, Prince Charles Edward landed on the
south-west coast of Inverness-shire, and asked the
neighbouring chiefs to join him in a new rebellion.
He came, personally a stranger in the land, with
a suite of seven gentlemen, to conquer a throne
from which, fifty-seven years previously, his
grandfather had been driven with ignominy and
disgrace. There must have been a charm of person
and manners in the prince—now in his twenty-fifth
year—by which he won the hearts, and, even
against their judgments, the enthusiastic support
of the chiefs, who met him with the intention of
persuading him to return to France. He lives in
Scottish song and story as “Bonnie Prince
Charlie”—the idol of the clansmen.</p>

<p>CHARLES EDWARD, THE YOUNG PRETENDER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Some leading chiefs as MacDonald of Sleat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>and MacLeod of MacLeod, declined to join the
enterprise; but one man of foremost note—Cameron
of Lochiel—declared for the prince, and
sent out a gathering summons to arms. About
two thousand men saluted the standard when,
on August 19th, it was set up at Glenfinnan. On
the 3rd of September, the prince entered Perth;
a fortnight later he was in Edinburgh. The
magistrates had tried to organize a volunteer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>defence of the city; but when the words passed
round, “the Highlanders are in sight,” the gates
were opened. But the castle held out for King
George.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir John Cope, the Commander of the royal
forces in Scotland had, at the news of the
rebellion, gone with 1500 men into the Highlands;
but, evading the prince’s forces, he took shipping
at Aberdeen, landed at Dunbar, and with reinforcements,
marched on Edinburgh. The prince
met him at Prestonpans, eight miles east of
Edinburgh, and a battle was there fought on the
morning of 21st September. The rush of the
highlanders, with broadsword and target, here, as
at Killiecrankie, carried the day. The royal
troops were completely routed, and their
artillery, baggage, and military chest fell to the
victors.</p>

<p class='c006'>The prince returned to Edinburgh amidst
popular acclamations. His adventure had now
assumed a more serious aspect. For a time it
seemed as if the whole of Scotland,—except the
castles of Edinburgh and Stirling, and the
highland garrisons—was at his feet. Dundee and
Perth were held by highland contingents;
Glasgow was subjected to a payment of £5,000.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>But it was six weeks before, from other highland
clans coming in, and from lowland enlistments,
his army mustered 5,500 men. At Holyrood
balls and festivities, he courteously enacted the
royal host. On October 31st, he began his march
southwards, entering England by the western
border.  He took Carlisle, passed through
Preston, Wigan, and Manchester, arriving at
Derby on 4th December. The march was in two
divisions; the front division was commanded by
Lord George Murray, a thorough soldier in
courage and ability. The rear division was led
by the prince himself,—generally in highland
garb, his target on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c006'>At Derby the prince might have said with
Henry of Lancaster:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thus far into the bowels of the land,</div>
      <div class='line'>Have we marched on without impediment.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But what next—and next? A larger and better
appointed army than his own, commanded by the
Duke of Cumberland, was at Lichfield, only
twenty-five miles to the south-west; another
army, equal in numbers to his own, under
Marshal Wade, was marching down on his rear
through Yorkshire. The general opinion of a
Council of War was for retreat. The prince at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>first refused his assent; he sulked over it for a
day, and then gave in with a bad grace, saying he
would call no more Councils of War, but act
entirely on his own judgment. Early next
morning—the 6th of December—the cheerless
retreat began.</p>

<p class='c006'>The very audacity of the irruption into
England fostered an idea in the minds of both
friends and enemies that the prince had some
secret but well-founded assurance of powerful
support, which in due time would reveal itself.
But the idea was seen to be baseless when the
highland brogues began to retrace the northern
roads. In passing through Manchester on the
march, there had been bonfires, acclamations,
hand-kissing, and a display of white cockades.
Ten days later, in the retreat, there was in
Manchester a mob-demonstration against the
highlanders; when they left the town, their rear
guard was hooted and fired upon.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>When the Duke of Cumberland learned of the
retreat of the rebels, he hastened against them
with all his cavalry; but their rear-guard, under
Lord George Murray, gallantly repelled all
attacks; and on 20th December, the prince’s
army was again on Scottish ground. After
levying contributions on Glasgow and Dumfries,
he proceeded towards Stirling, making the
historical village of Bannockburn his headquarters.
Here he was joined by considerable reinforcements,
including the clans Frazer, Farquharson,
MacKenzie, and Macintosh. Simon, Lord Lovat,
the aged chief of the Frazers, had been
playing fast and loose, negotiating with the Prince
for a dukedom as the price of his support; at the
same time assuring the government of his loyalty,
and asking for arms to enable his clan to act
against the rebels. In the end, he sent his son
with 750 Frazers to join the princes standard;
the crafty old fox himself remaining at home in
pretended neutrality. By the middle of January
the prince’s muster-roll reached its maximum—about
8,500 men.</p>

<p class='c006'>The prince had opened trenches for a regular
siege of Stirling Castle, when he learned that
General Hawley with 8,000 men, most of them
veterans from the French wars, was marching
against him. Lord George Murray—knowing that
with such an army as that of the rebels, the
chances of success lay more in attack than defence—made
a rapid march on Hawley. On the
afternoon of January 17th, a battle was fought on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Falkirk Moor. It was a wild fight, in a blinding
storm of wind and rain. The darkening mists
prevented combined operations on both sides.
Divisions of each army drove back their immediate
opponents, but themselves got into disorder in
pursuit. Hawley in belief of defeat, fired his tents,
fell back on Linlithgow, and next morning took
his army to Edinburgh.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the battle of Falkirk, the prince was
for continuing the siege, but such plodding work
did not suit the Highlanders, and the chiefs
addressed a memorandum to him, advising
retreat. He fumed and protested, but had again
to yield. On February 4th, the Forth was
forded, and the retreat began; it was a leisurely
one, no royalist force of any magnitude being in
the Highlands. Inverness was occupied by the
prince on February 18th. Forts George and
Augustus surrendered; Lord Loudon took what
royalist troops he could collect into Ross-shire,
where they were joined by the Whig MacDonalds.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Duke of Cumberland came to Edinburgh,
and organized an army. In addition to his
British troops, 6,000 Hessians were landed at
Leith.  The army marched by Perth to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Aberdeen. On the 8th of April, the Duke left
Aberdeen; on the 14th, he was at Nairn, 16 miles
north of Inverness. His troops numbered 9,000
men,—a compact, well-fed, well-disciplined army,
with full confidence in their leader, as a man of
courage and large military experience.</p>

<p class='c006'>The prince had not expected that the duke
would leave Aberdeen before May, and his
troops were scattered about. They had been for
weeks in a state of semi-starvation, and had to
roam the country to find food for a bare subsistence.
The men were discontented for lack of
pay; the leaders were jealous and suspicious of
each other; some of the clans claimed special
rights and precedences. It was a divided, a
disheartened, almost a demoralized army of 7,000
men which, on April 15th, stood, with barely
one ration for each man in the commissariat, upon
Culloden Moor, about four miles north-east of
Inverness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Unequally matched as the two armies would
have been if they had met on the 15th, they were
much more so on the next day, when the battle
joined. For in the intervening night, a strategical
misadventure prostrated the spirit and weakened
the efficiency of the prince’s army. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>an abortive attempt at a night attack on the
royalist camp. After a long weary march, the
rebel army failed to concentrate in time for a
night surprise; and, disheartened and fatigued,
it marched back to Culloden Moor. Here, many
at once lay down to sleep, others scattered in
search of food. At noon of the 16th, the two
armies confronted each other.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lord George Murray was watching for the proper
moment to attack, but, without waiting for orders,
the clans in the centre and right wings rushed
down with their broadswords, and in spite of a
galling fire broke through the front line of the
enemy. But the second line had been trained to
resist a Highland onset; they reserved their fire
until the clansmen had almost reached the points
of the bayonets, and then it told with deadly
effect. The broadswords could not penetrate the
steady line of bayonets; for the assailants it was
either flight or death.</p>

<p class='c006'>The three MacDonald regiments had been
placed in the left wing of the rebel army. They
claimed the right wing, and even in the supreme
moment of battle, Highland pride predominated
over military duty. They did not respond to the
order to advance, and retired upon the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>line. And now, a boundary wall on the prince’s
right had been thrown down by the Argyleshire
Campbells, and a way made for the duke’s cavalry
to operate on the flank and rear. His main army
advanced in compact order, and it became a panic,
and “save himself who can,” with the clansmen.
The MacDonalds and a portion of the second
line retired in fair order; but the duke’s cavalry
cut off all stragglers; and all the wounded rebels
on the battlefield, even those who were next
morning found alive, were—by the duke’s orders
it is said—savagely put to death.</p>

<p class='c006'>And not with the fever-madness of battle did
the savageries terminate. Cumberland had at
Carlisle, where the prince had unwisely left a
small garrison, begun a course of atrocity; and he
now went over the Highlands, a very demon of
cruelty and destruction. This prince of the
blood-royal of England gave his soldiery licence
to shoot in cold blood the male inhabitants,
to plunder the houses of the chieftains, to
drive off the cattle and burn the huts of the
peasants; to outrage the women. His ducal
title ought to have died with him; for what
man of honour or common humanity but
would feel it a disgrace to bear an appellation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>made for ever infamous by the <i>Butcher of
Culloden</i>?</p>

<p class='c006'>And the penalties of law supplemented the
work of the sword. Lords Kilmarnock, Balmerino
and Lovat, were beheaded on Tower Hill,—the
last deaths by decapitation in Britain. About a
hundred persons were hanged in Scotland, and
fifty in England; hundreds were sent to the
plantations. Of course it had been rebellion, but
so far as the rebels were concerned, it had been a
fair, stand-up fight; they had lost all but honour.
They had not been robbers, or guilty of violence
towards civilians; they had not maltreated their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>prisoners, but set them free on parole, which was
often broken. Humanity and sound policy might
well have spoken for mercy.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the prince saw the enemy closing in
upon his broken host, he may have hesitated
whether he should not stand and meet death,
sword in hand; but his friends took hold of his
horse’s bridle and turned it from the field. With
few attendants he rode to Castle Downie, the
residence of Lord Lovat. On seeing the prince
a fugitive, the crafty old man felt the ground
trembling under his own feet; so the prince had
only a hasty meal, and again rode on. He passed
by Invergarry into the West Highlands; there,
and in the Western Isles, he was for over five
months a hunted outlaw. Government offered a
reward of £30,000 for his capture; yet, although
one time and another hundreds knew of his
whereabouts, not one of these grasped at this,
to them, fabulous amount, through treachery.
But the soldiery and unfriendly clansmen were
vigilantly on the outlook.</p>

<p class='c006'>The prince had, in his wanderings, gone to the
outer Hebrides, and was lodged in a forester’s
hut, in a cleft of the hills. General Campbell
landed at South Uist to make a minute search of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>the islands. The MacDonalds of Skye were also
there, engaged in the same task,—a hunt-party of
two thousand men. We can imagine the avidity
of the search—the warrant for a huge fortune
might be found under any bracken bush on the
hillside,—within any clump of trees, or beneath
any overhanging cliff. When escape seemed
impossible, a woman’s compassion and a woman’s
wit came to the rescue.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>No feminine name is in Scotland more honoured
or awakens higher thoughts of courage and
devotion than that of Flora MacDonald. She
belonged to the MacDonalds who were inimical to
the prince, and was—when she came to know of
his straits—on a visit to the house of Sir
Alexander MacDonald. But she boldly asked
the chief for a passport for herself, a man-servant,
and a maid-servant, to enable her to visit relatives
in a neighbouring island. The prince, dressed
up as maid “Bridget,” shewed awkward enough,
but without detection the party reached the house
of MacDonald of Kingsburgh, to whom Flora was
afterwards married. From there the prince again
reached the mainland.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here he had, in a closely-watched district,
several hair-breadth escapes, and found that
misery <em>does</em> acquaint a man with strange bedfellows!
One refuge was a robber’s cave, the
other occupants being outlawed cattle-stealers.
They knew the prince, and treated him with the
same loyal respect as, ten months previously, had
been shewn him in the halls of Holyrood. He
was at length able to join Lochiel and other
outlawed adherents. Friends along the coast
were watching for a French vessel. One appearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>on September 20th, nearly a hundred persons
were safely embarked. The prince is described
as looking like the spectre of his former self,—pale,
haggard, and ragged. But his companions
received him with bonnets doffed and loyal
salutations. Although chased by an English
cruiser, the vessel got safely to Marlaix, in
Brittany.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. As a rule—and indeed the custom has not yet entirely ceased in the
country districts of Scotland—wives retained their full maiden names after
marriage, and in both sexes the christian or given name was held to be—as
doubtless it virtually is—the proper designation of a person,—the
surname indicating the family or clan to which he or she belonged. On
Scottish tombstones to this day, the inscription for the loss of a child by a
married couple will read as “Son of John Smith and Barbara Allen.”</p>

impracticable project.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The following are a few extracts from a large number of
favourable reviews of “Bygone England”</i>:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“We welcome ‘Bygone England.’ It is another of Mr. Andrews’ meritorious
achievements in the path of popularising archæological and old-time
information without in any way writing down to an ignoble level.”—<cite>The
Antiquary.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“This is a book which will give instruction as well as entertainment to all
who read it, and it will serve to awaken interest in the old and quaint customs
of our native land.”—<cite>Sala’s Journal.</cite></p>

and instructive. Mr. Andrews is quite a master of curious and out-of-the-way
knowledge.”—<cite>Scottish Leader.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“‘A delightful book,’ is the verdict that the reader will give after a perusal
of its pages. Mr. Andrews has presented to us in very pleasing form some
phases of the social life of England in the olden time.”—<cite>Publishers’ Circular.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“Some of the chapters are very interesting, and are most useful for those
who desire to know the origin and history of some of our daily practices and
amusements.”—<cite>The World.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“In recommending this book to the general public, we do so, feeling confident
that within its pages they will find much that is worth knowing, that
they will never find their interest flag, nor their curiosity ungratified.”—<cite>Hull
Daily News.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“A volume which may be cordially recommended to all who love to stray
in historical byways.”—<cite>Shields Daily Gazette.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“A very readable and instructive volume.”—<cite>The Globe.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“Many are the subjects of interest introduced in this chatty volume.”—<cite>Saturday
Review.</cite></p>

and customs, and to penetrate into the byways of history.”—<cite>Liverpool Daily
Post.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“There is a large mass of information in this capital volume, and it is so
pleasantly put that many will be tempted to study it. Mr. Andrews has done
his work with great skill.”—<cite>London Quarterly Review.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“It is impossible to read this book without a feeling of gratitude to Mr.
Andrews for his labours. The subjects have been so well selected, and are
treated in so attractive a manner, that the reader may open the volume at any
page and find something which will rivet his attention.... A good index
is provided, and the book is well printed and got up.”—<cite>Manchester Examiner.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“Mr. Wm. Stevenson, of several of whose previous works
Nottingham and the shire have formed the bases, adds to the list
an exceedingly interesting and useful book on the county, under the
title of ‘Bygone Nottinghamshire,’ illustrated by a large number of
engravings from photographs, old prints, and other sources. The
writer’s aim has been to incorporate much information beyond the
reach of ordinary students on the past history of the county, and
thereby to prove the shire is, as he believes, rich beyond comparison
in ancient lore.... A most pleasant addition to local history.”—<cite>Nottingham
Daily Guardian.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“We welcome Mr. Stevenson’s book as a useful addition to the
literature of the county.”—<cite>Newark Advertiser.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“This recent volume of Messrs. Andrews and Company’s series of
‘Bygones’ is a treasure to <i>bona-fide</i> students of Nottinghamshire
history. The compilation of the whole book is solely the work of
Mr. W. Stevenson, an ardent and original student of local history as
now accepted. The book is well illustrated, the maps and plans
being most valuable.... We have not space to do full justice to
‘Bygone Nottinghamshire,’ but in heartily commending it to all
readers, we may say that if judged by the mean standard of quantity
alone it is good value for money; but it is more than that, for besides
being a popular work, it is also an original one—an exceedingly
unusual combination.”—<cite>Notts and Derbyshire Notes and Queries.</cite></p>

Quarterly Review.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“Local archæologists will give a hearty welcome to this book.”—<cite>Manchester
Guardian.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“Mr. Thornely has produced a very interesting volume, as he has not only figured
nearly every monumental brass within the two counties to which he has confined his
researches, but in every case he has given a description also, and in some instances the
genealogical information is of a high order of value.”—<cite>The Tablet.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“A well got-up and profusely-illustrated volume.”—<cite>Manchester Examiner and
Times.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“This book is wonderfully readable for its kind, and is evidently the result of careful
and painstaking labour. The chapters are well condensed, nowhere burdened with
verbiage, yet sufficiently full to serve the purpose in view. The illustrations of the
various brasses are exceedingly well done, and add much value and interest to the work,
which should become popular in Lancashire and Cheshire.”—<cite>Warrington Guardian.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“‘The Monumental Brasses of Lancashire and Cheshire,’ with some account of the
persons represented, by James L. Thornely, is a volume of great antiquarian interest to
residents in the two counties. It has been a labour of love, and embodies the results, as
the author remarks in his preface, of many pleasant hours during a series of pilgrimages
to ancient churches and sweet communings with a stately past. The plates in the
volume are reproductions of pen and ink drawings made from ‘rubbings,’ most of which
were taken by the author, and the descriptive letterpress relates to the ancestry of many
old Lancashire and Cheshire families, and is full of antiquarian and historical interest.”—<cite>Liverpool
Daily Post.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“The volume is excellently printed and finished, and its production reflects great
credit on its publishers—the Hull Press.”—<cite>Hull Daily News.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“The author’s artistic drawings of the brasses he describes, as may be imagined,
embrace numbers of curious outlines, from the rudest to many of elegant design. Each
is accompanied by as copious a description as it seems possible to obtain, the work on the
whole covering over three hundred pages of well-executed letterpress. Only five
hundred copies have been printed, and these have been nearly all taken up by
subscribers.”—<cite>Chester Courant.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“Messrs. William Andrews &amp; Co., of Hull” (“Logroller” writes in the <cite>Star</cite>),
“seem to be producing some handsome antiquarian books. The latest that has come to
me is an account of ‘The Monumental Brasses of Lancashire and Cheshire,’ by Mr.
James L. Thornely. Brass-rubbing is a most fascinating enthusiasm. ‘Wouldst thou
know the beauty of holiness?’ asks Lamb. ‘Go alone on some week-day, borrowing the
keys of good Master Sexton, traverse the cool aisles of some country church.’ Those
cool aisles are the workshop of the brass-rubber. While he kneels over his spread sheet
of paper, and diligently plies his ‘heel-ball,’ the afternoon lights dapple the old stones,
and country sounds and scents steal in to keep him company at his solitary task. You see
I also have been in Arcady. Mr. Thornely is not only interested in his subject himself,
but he has the gift of imparting his interest to others. His accounts of his various
brasses and the personages they commemorate are simple and clear, and marked by a
literary touch too rare in the treatment of such themes.”</p>

<p class='c023'>“The fifty pages, by no means overcrowded, which Mr. Elvet Lewis
has given us, go far to justify the hope that a new poet of genuine power
has arisen among us. The thought is often singularly beautiful. The
expression is so simple and so natural that it conceals the art. The
delicacy of the workmanship may easily blind us to the strength. Mr.
Lewis is essentially original, though his affinities are closest, perhaps, to
Whittier and Lynch: but there is not a trace of imitation to be found in
the book from one end to the other.”—<cite>Literary World.</cite></p>

<p class='c024'>“This little volume possesses a rare charm for the lovers of really good
verse. The writer is evidently of the number of those whose spirituality
is intense, and whose faith in, and hold of, the things “not seen and
eternal” are vivid and strong. The opening poem, which gives the work
its title—‘My Christ’ is singularly beautiful for the spirit of love, loyalty,
and devotion which it breathes in every line. Altogether, the poems
are of a high order, and quite worthy of ranking alongside such works
as ‘The Lyra Innocentium’ and ‘The Christian Year.’”—<cite>Hull Times.</cite></p>

<p class='c024'>“The verses are worthy of Mr. Lewis’ poetic genius, and breathe a
spirit of devotion which will certainly have an uplifting influence upon
those who peruse the verses. Mr. Lewis has a pure style, and in the
poems before us there are a few gems of thought which shew their
originator to be an author of great ability.”—<cite>Llanelly Guardian.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“The author of a ‘Month in a Dandi’ has a facile pen, and is evidently
a shrewd observer. Her book differs from many belonging to the same
class by reason of its freshness, its spontaneity, and its abundance of
interesting detail. Moreover, the book is written with a purpose. ‘If
by perusing these pages the reader obtains a clearer view of England’s
attitude to her great dependency, if his prepossessions against ‘black
men’ and the ‘poor heathen’ should melt away in any degree, if the
assumption that what is good for England must necessarily be so for
India receives a slight shake, the writer will feel rewarded.’ To these
conclusions one is almost certain to come when the experiences of Miss
Bremner’s ‘Month in a Dandi’ are recalled. There would be no end to
our quotations were we to reproduce all the passages we have marked
as being interesting. Miss Bremner is always in good spirits, and writes
with ease, and evidently <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>con amore</i></span>.”—<cite>Birmingham Daily Gazette.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“Miss Bremner’s book describes a woman’s wanderings in Northern
India, and it is written from adequate knowledge, with shrewd discernment,
and a pleasing amount of vivacity.—<cite>Speaker.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“‘A Month in a Dandi’ is full of instruction. It shows a great deal of
ability and determination to express truths, even if they be unpalatable.
The chapters on the vexed questions of Baboo culture and Indian
Congress are well worth reading.”—<cite>Manchester Guardian.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“Miss Bremner’s style is chastened for the most part, humorous, faithful
to detail, and oftentimes polished to literary excellence. The earlier
chapters are full of raciness and agreeable personality.”—<cite>Hull Daily Mail.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“‘A Month in a Dandi’ describes the writer’s wanderings in Northern
India, following upon a shrewdly observant account of the seamy side of
Anglo-Indian Society. The subject throughout is approached from a
political economist’s point of view. The chapter on the growing poverty
of India sounds a warning note.”—<cite>Gentlewoman.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“The author of a ‘Month in a Dandi’ is evidently a keen observer of
men and things, and we know that her opinion is shared by many of our
countrymen who have had a much larger experience of India and Indian
affairs than herself. The book is full of the most exquisite word pictures,
pictures that are full of light, beauty, and grace, but, unfortunately, some
of them have more shade than we care to see; but, doubtless, Miss
Bremner’s treatment is correct and life-like.”—<cite>Hull Daily News.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>The following are selected from a large number of favourable notices:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“The author has evidently reflected deeply on the subject of Socialism,
and his views are broad, equitable, and quite up to date. In a score or
so of chapters he discusses Socialism from manifold points of view, and in
its manifold aspects. Mr. Maxwell is not a fanatic; his book is not dull,
and his style is not amateurish.”—<cite>Hull Daily Mail.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“There is a good deal of charm about Mr. Maxwell’s style.”—<cite>Northern
Daily News.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“The book is well worthy of perusal.”—<cite>Hull News.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“The reader who desires more intimate acquaintance with a subject
that is often under discussion at the present day, will derive much interest
from a perusal of this little work. Whether it exactly expresses the views
of the various socialists themselves is another matter, but inasmuch as
these can seldom agree even among themselves, the objection is scarcely so
serious as might otherwise be thought.”—<cite>Publisher’s Circular.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“Mr. Lloyd has redeemed his story by sprightly incident and some admirable
character sketches. Madge, whom the hero eventually marries,
is a charming creation, and yet ‘not too light and good for human
nature’s daily food.’ Her sister and her husband, Tom Coltman, are
also a fine couple, and Mr. Lloyd introduces us to some very clever
scenes at the theatre at which they perform. The hero’s sister, Gladys,
is another favourite, and the family to which she is introduced consists
of many persons in whom the reader is bound to take an interest. Mr.
Lloyd works up the climax in a truly masterly manner, and the discovery
of the father of the ‘children of chance,’ is ingenious and clever.
In short we have little but praise for this book.... The reader’s
interest is aroused from the first and is sustained to the end. There is
pathos in the story and there is humour, and Mr. Lloyd writes very
gracefully and tenderly where grace and tenderness are needed.”—<cite>Birmingham
Daily Gazette.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“The story ... is full of action and movement, and is never
dull.”—<cite>The Scotsman.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“Messrs. William Andrews &amp; Co., of Hull, have opened their ‘Library
of Popular Fiction’ with a brightly-written novel by Herbert Lloyd,
entitled ‘Children of Chance.’ The treatment of the story is distinctly
above the average.... The character of Richard Framley, though
a minor one, is very cleverly limned, and a forcible piece of writing in
the last chapter but one, will leave a vivid impression even to the reader
who merely skims the book. Altogether the ‘Library’ has reached a
high standard with its initial volume.”—<cite>Eastbourne Observer.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“Those who can appreciate a good story told in plain and simple language
will probably find a good deal of pleasure in perusing ‘Children of
Chance,’ by Herbert Lloyd. It is altogether devoid of sensationalism.
At the same time one feels an interest in the various couples who are
introduced, and whose love-making is recorded in a very agreeable
manner.... Mr. Lloyd succeeds in depicting an effective scene at
the final denouement, the period before it being attractively filled in. It
is artistically worked out.”—<cite>Sala’s Journal.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“The story is strengthened by the interest attaching to its women,
and by a certain lightness of touch and naturalness in the portrayal of
the life of an artistic family. Some of the characters are both well
drawn and likeable, and one or two strong incidents redeem the general
tone of the plot.”—<cite>Glasgow Herald.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“This is decidedly a good novel, and the plot is sufficiently exciting
to attract a reader and hold him to the end.”—<cite>The Publishers’ Circular.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“The author of ‘Children of Chance,’ grasps one of the first essentials
of fiction, dramatic effect.... There is no lack of new ideas, and
the story is not uninteresting.”—<cite>The Literary World.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“The plot of ‘Children of Chance,’ by Herbert Lloyd, is in many
ways a powerful one.... There are several strong situations, and
the book is well worth reading.”—<cite>The Yorkshire Post.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“‘Children of Chance,’ which inaugurates Andrews’ ‘Library of
Popular Fiction,’ enforces the lesson of evil consequences that may be
expected to follow upon foul deeds deliberately wrought.... The
interest in the career of Cecil Studholme and his children is kept well
alive.”—<cite>The Academy.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“This is a well-balanced and cleverly written novel. Some fine
realistic work is displayed in the delineation of several characters, a
trait which shows that the author has kept a high ideal before him in
his constructive processes.... Love episodes come in, and the
conversation is exceedingly healthy and natural. The volume is
beautifully got-up.”—<cite>The Perthshire Advertiser.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“There is plenty of love-making in the story, several of the
characters are well drawn, and the plot is an ingenious one.”—<cite>Northern
Evening Mail.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“Much of Mr. Lloyd’s book is bright, fresh, and ingenious.... The
plot is cleverly conceived, and shows careful treatment from
beginning to end.... There are in ‘Children of Chance’ notable
instances where a deep insight into human nature is perceptible; many
scenes, such as that which closes on the life of the deserted wife, show a
touch of pathos of which many a more noted author might feel justly
proud; while at times the dialogue is far from indifferent.”—<cite>Hull News.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“‘Children of Chance’ is the pioneer volume of Andrews’ ‘Library of
Fiction.’ It ought to win its way to popular favour. Its attractive
binding and excellent printing are commendable features, while the
story itself displays high literary merit. Mr. Lloyd does not lack the
modern fiction writer’s capacity for the creation of sensational incidents;
but he manages his plots with ingenuity and success, and his morality is
thoroughly sound.”—<cite>North Eastern Daily Gazette.</cite></p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
